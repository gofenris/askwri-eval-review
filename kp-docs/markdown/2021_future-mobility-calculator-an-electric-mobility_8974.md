summary: "The FMC quantifies EV charging infrastructure, costs, and social benefits for urban passenger mobility through 2050, covering four vehicle modes: private cars, two-wheelers, public buses, and shared fleets. Output accuracy depends heavily on key inputs: population growth rate, 2020 vehicle stock, modal split, occupancy rates, trip length, charger power, and cost values. Over 500 default data points drawn from IPCC, IEA, World Bank, and ICCT fill data gaps across four city typologies defined by density and income. Emission factors cover only tailpipe and electricity generation; braking and tire friction, autonomous vehicles, freight, and smart charging are excluded."

Abstract 
Mass e lectrification within the transport sector presents a n opportunity  to simultaneously 
reduce tailpipe emissions  by switching propulsion technolo gies and to improve the electrical 
grid. Fully realizing the potential that electric vehicles (EV) offer requires a robust roadmap for 
infrastructure development and investment to ensure deployment  is cost effective and 
resource efficient. To help quantify the infrastructure and investment needed for EV adoption 
for urban passenger mobility and its associated benefits , this paper introduces the  Future 
Mobility Calculator (FMC). Developed by WRI and Siemens in collaboration with the Coalition 
for Urban Transitions, t he FMC is an Excel -based tool that —for a given ra nge of city -specific 
inputs and a projected rate of  transport electrification—identifies the quantity and cost of 
infrastructure required for EV adoption through 2050. The tool also estimates the potential 
social benefits associated with a reduction in emi ssions that would result from electrification 
and modal shifts.  The FMC does not  provide a comparative cost -benefit analysis  between 
scenarios but is rather designed to estimate impacts of a designated EV uptake scenario 
developed by the user given a set of inputs and assumptions. The FMC is intended to be used by 
modelers to support  city planners, transit agencies , city policy makers , utilities, and charge 
point operators. The FMC aims to help cities make informed decisions and plan accordingly for 
the future of their mobility and energy systems.  This technical note details the structure, 
methodology and assumptions (listed separately under each section) of the FMC.

1 Introduction 
1.1 Background  
As urban centers continue to grow, so will the share of global emissions they produce linked to 
an expanding transport sector and increased electricity consumption. In 2019, transportation 
accounted for 24 percent of global CO2 emissions (IEA 2020)  and is the fastest growing 
emissions sector (Wang and Ge 2019), with road vehicles accounting for nearly three-quarters 
of all transport CO2 emissions. Electrification within the transport sector presents a solution to 
help mitigate potential emissions associated with the  growth of cities by reducing tailpipe 
emissions and improving grid functionality and sustainability through smart charging.  
While the promise of EVs for emissions reductions and reduced operational costs are attractive, 
uptake of the technology at scale will require the development of a robust  vehicle adoption 
pathway and charging infrastructure network. To help facilitate planning, this paper introduces 
the Future Mobility Calculator (FMC). Developed by WRI and Siemens in collaboration with the 
Coalition for Urban Transitions, the FMC  focuses on the urban infrastructure needed for 
successful EV and charging station rollout and the costs and social benefits associated with that 
investment. Understanding the appropriate quantity and type of charging stations to install, the 
increased ele ctricity demand from EVs, and the cost (and social benefits)  of vehicle and 
infrastructure deployment are crucial for effective resource management, decision making, and 
building political support for electrification . The FMC aims to help cities make infor med 
decisions and plan accordingly for the future of their mobility and energy systems. 
The term "EVs" can refer to few different vehicle technologies including battery EVs (fully 
electric), plug-in hybrid EVs (battery and petrol), and fuel cell vehicles ( hydrogen fuel). While 
plug-in hybrid and fuel cell vehicles are an important part of the shift to sustainable transport, 
the FMC considers the adoption of battery EVs only, any reference to "EV" or "EVs" in this paper 
refers exclusively to fully electric battery EVs. 
1.2 Tool Overview  
The FMC is an Excel-based tool that, for a given range of city-specific inputs (general city data, 
mobility data, charging infrastructure data, and cost data) and a projected electric transport 
uptake scenario for 2035 and 2050, identifies the quantity and cost of infrastructure required. 
It also quantifies some of emissions benefits that would result  from an investment in electric 
transport infrastructure, based on input data and listed assumptions . The FMC is not intended 
to provide a direct comparative cost -benefit analysis against other propulsion technologies 
such as diesel, hydrogen or CNG. These types of comparisons are addressed in other literature 
and tools (UChicago Argonne, LLC 2019; Cooper et al. 2019a). Instead, the main purpose of the 
tool is to estimate the costs, requirements, and  some of the  key benefits of defined 
electrification scenarios, which are needed to effectively plan for future EV use.  
The FMC is designed to provide a city -specific analysis, informed by the city-specific inputs  
entered by the user. When user inputs are not available, the tool provides def aults. These 
defaults vary based on the typology of the city, but they represent broad and generic 
estimations. The less default inputs that are needed, the more the calculator outputs will reflect 
the reality of the city.  Likewise, the user should take ca re to match the geographic scope of all

6 
 
data. Users are encouraged to manually enter as many city-specific inputs as they are able and 
to avoid mixing with regional data to the extent possible. 
The FMC is designed to accommodate inputs for four modes of mo torized transit: private car, 
private two-wheeler, public bus, and shared fleet vehicle.  This tool is designed for fully battery 
electric vehicles and not for plug -in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) or hydrogen fuel cell 
vehicles. Users may include PHEVs  in their total EV count, but the vehicle specifications 
included in the tool are tailored to the attributes of battery electric vehicles.  Since the tool is 
designed specifically to plan for electric vehicles (and not to p rovide guidance on other topics 
related to general mobility planning), the tool does not analyze non-motorized transportation. 
The user designates a desired future transport electrification scenario for the years 2035 and 
2050. 
The FMC incorporates a transparent interface allowing the user to view inputs and calculations 
as well as integrate their own data , allowing complete customization for the city in question.  
The tool is open-sourced, and users can change any desired default assumptions, in addition to 
the suggested city -specific inputs . For example, the user can change  the default emission 
factors, default assumption for battery efficiency loss in hot or cold climates,  or any other 
default assumption in the tool.  
When city -specific data is not available , the tool is programmed with over 500 default data 
points, which help fill gaps in the user’s data. These default inputs are sourced from work done 
by a range of institutions including the IPCC, World Bank, C40, IEA, IRENA, US EPA, UNEP, and 
ICCT among ot hers. Inputs are based on p resent day and projected values as well as 
assumptions inferred based on trends.  Based on the city’s population density and economy, 
these default inputs are sourced from four pre-loaded city typologies: (1) emerging economy – 
high density, (2) developed economy – low density, (3) developed economy – high density, and 
(4) emerging economy – low density. While no planning tool can provide complete scenarios 
with absolute certainty, the FMC uses these different city typologies to source specific default 
inputs which are intended to be most applicable to the city in question.  
The FMC is specifically designed to conduct city-level analysis, but the geographic extent of the 
city’s analysis can be modified depending on how the user defines a city’s limits in the inputs. 
Using the city-specific inputs entered by the user in conjunction wi th default inputs, the tool 
estimates the emission reductions, number of necessary EV purchases, electricity consumption, 
and required number and type of EV charging stations.  
1.3 Tool Structure  
The FMC is an excel-based tool developed around three primary operational sections: 
 Data input tabs: Initial Data Input, city, mobility, charging, and cost.  
 Calculation tabs: Mobility, charging, cost, emissions, and benefits. 
 Results tabs: Results and Yearly Selected Costs-Benefits 
The general informational flow within the tab is broken down visually in Figure 1. Building on 
basic city information  from Initial Data Input , user inputs  in the remaining data  input tabs 
combined with default data are used in Calculation tabs to produce outcomes in the Results. A 
complete list of the tabs included in the FMC is shown in Table 1.

Note: Tabs are divided by Tab Type  and Tab Name. Data input, Default input, and Calculation 
tabs are further separated by the Tool Section they are associated with. Note that some sections 
of the tool such as Emissions, only have a Calculation tab , where inputs  for those calculations 
are sourced from other sections of the tool.  Similarly, the City  section does not have a 
calculation tab, where City inputs feed into other calculation sheets , but the City section does 
not have a calculation tab of its own. Source: WRI 
1.3.1 Main Configuration 
 Figure 2. Screenshot of the Initial Data Entry tab, where users input basic city information and define a city typology.   
 
 
Source: WRI     
The Initial Data Entry tab gathers basic city attributes and establishes the City Typology  
associated with the city under analysis. For information on how these typologies were chosen, 
see Annex 1. The selected City Typology will inform the Default Inputs used throughout the tool. 
Inputs for Initial Data Entry can be seen in Figure 2. Current and future electricity generation is 
designated as moderate, low-carbon, or dirty, depending on the mix of  electricity generation 
sources input by the user. The ranges for these three categories are defined in Table 2. This tab 
also includes an option to indicate if your city experiences temperature extremes , which can 
impact battery performance.   
1.3.2 Data Input and Calculation 
Data Input tabs are where the user enters the bulk of the city’s data used in the tool. Associated 
with e ach Data Input tab is a Default Data tab, which houses the City Typo logy default 
information. The inputs for each of the Data Input tabs are listed visually in Figure 3. Given that 
the FMC is a long-term planning tool, the inputs for the default data tab should reference overall

trends over the long-term. Short- and medium-term influences, such as the impact of COVID-19 
or other topical issues, are not intended to be reflected by this tool. 
Calculation tabs utilize the values from Data Input tabs to draw out relationships in the data 
and produce tool outputs.  Outputs from one Calculation tab are often utilized in another 
Calculation tab to help produce results.

1.3.4 Limitations 
Although the FMC provides a robust calculation framework, it faces some limitations: 
 
• Accuracy of the outputs will significantly depend on the degree and accuracy of city-
specific inputs from the user . Default data is provided to help fill out potential gaps in 
the user’s data input and is based on comparative assumptions from existing literature.  
• Some data inputs have more weight than others. The FMC analysis is built around 
several key inputs including, population growth rate, 2020 vehicle population, modal 
split, average vehicle occupancy rate, trip length, charger power, and monetary input 
values included in the Cost Data. Users should pay particular attention to the accuracy 
of these key central inputs. 
• The term “ EVs” can refer to few different vehicle technologies including battery EVs 
(fully electric), plug-in hybrid EVs (battery and petrol), and fuel cell vehicles (hydrogen 
fuel). While plug-in hybrid and fuel cell vehicles are an important part of the shift to 
sustainable transport, t he FMC considers the adoption of battery EVs only, any 
reference to “EV” or “EVs” in this paper refers exclusively to fully electric battery EVs. 
• The FMC uses 2020 as a baseline year for analysis. Short- and medium-term influences, 
such as the impact of COVID-19 or other topical issues, are not intended to be reflected 
by this tool. 
• The FMC produces estimates of the quantity and cost of infrastructure associated with 
EV uptake scenarios built by the user. These estimates can be used to compare different 
EV uptake scenarios. The outcomes produced in different scenarios are not intended to 
show which outcomes are more or less likely to occur.  
• In all annual ridership calculations, the authors assume the  default number of days as 
365.  
• The tool is not intended to help cities decide which propulsion systems would be best 
for their fleets. These types of comparisons are addressed in other literature and tools, 
including recent work produced by WRI  (Cooper et al. 2019a) . Rather, this tool 
is designed to provide estimates of the energy and infrastructure needs for a given 
electrification scenario and an analysis of the associated costs and some social benefits.  
• The emission factors estimations in this tool are related only to tailpipe and e lectricity 
generation, as the ones coming from suspended material due to vehicle operation, such 
as vehicle braking and tire friction, are not considered in this version of the FMC. 
• In its analysis the FMC focuses on  a limited number of transport modes including 
private cars, private two-wheelers, shared fleets (cars), and public buses and rail. 
• In terms of electricity generation, when users define their future electricity generation 
mix, the FMC does not account for the infrastructure requirements and costs associated 
with increasing the share of renewable generation on the grid. When calculating the 
daily electricity load the grid will experience from EV adoption, the tool  it is assumed 
the charging load will be distributed equally over the course of the day (24 hours). The 
location and duration of EV charging occurring during the day is a major determinant 
of the upgrades which will be required (or could be offset) to power distribution and 
generation infrastructure. The tool also does not consider smart charging or any 
vehicle-to-grid integration, which will likely impact the use of charging ports.

12 
 
• The social benefits included in the tool do not measure or account for the value of time 
of residents in the city. 
• While the costs associated with health impacts are incorporated into the social cost 
values linked to pollutants in the tool, t here are several health and social impacts 
associated with air pollution (such as organ damage and lower reproductive rates) that 
the tool does not currently capture. 
• This tool does not include scenarios for electrifying trucks  and urban goods 
transportation.  
• The tool also does not consider how new technologies such as autonomous vehicles 
would impact the electrification process. 
• When the authors refer to ‘modal split’, they refer only the split between motorised 
options only.   
2 Tool Methodology & Configuration  
2.1 Tool Configuration  
Tool configuration and establishing the City Type occur within the Initial Data Entry tab. This 
section will describe the different city typologies and other parameters that calibrate the FMC 
to determine which default inputs will be used to fill in unknown data. For information on how 
these typologies were chosen, see Annex 1. For more reliable results, it is highly recommended 
that users input city-specific information (cells in yellow) about the city being analyzed instead 
of relying on default data.  
2.1.1 City Configuration (Input sheet—Initial Data Entry tab) 
This is the main configuration tab where users define and determine key attributes of the city 
under analysis. User inputs and selections in this tab will impact assumptions and calculations 
throughout the tool, to best reflect the city under analysis. There are four key selections that 
are impacted by this:  
 City Typology Selection  – Based on inputs for population density  and income per 
capita, the tool will determine the most appropriate City Type and associated default 
inputs for the city (see Annex 1 for definition of City Types) . The City Type can also be 
manually selected by the user. 
 Projected electricity generation mix – This informs the user whether the electricity 
generation in their city will be considered dirty, moderate, or low-carbon based on user 
assumptions made for the city’s projected low-carbon electricity generation. Please 
refer to City Section (below)  for benchmarking default data assumptions. For reliable 
results, it is preferred to have city-specific inputs from the user based on the city being 
analyzed. This information will likely be made available by local utility companies or at 
the system operator level (regional or national, especially for future projections). 
 Island State – This determines whether the city is on an isolated island or not. We have 
defined an isolated island as one which needs to import most of its electricity. This 
impacts electricity infrastructure and transmission costs. 
 Environmental Factor  – Determines if a city’s climate will have an impact on EV 
performance. Users may select if their city is considered hot (summer monthly average 
above 35C during the hottest month of the summer) and/or cold (monthly average

13 
 
below -6C during the coldest month of the winter) (Motoaki, Yi, and Salisbury 2018; 
Hawkins 2019) . If these attributes are present in a city, the too l will account for its 
impacts on additional battery use for climate control within the vehicle and impacts on 
battery performance.

14 
 
2.2 Data Input and Calculation Sheets 
2.2.1 City 
This section  comprises of the variables that depend on the physical, social and economic 
characteristics of the city. While the City Data tab does not correspond to “City Calculations,” as 
is the case with other tabs, these inputs are used throughout all of the calculations and are key 
inputs for the emissions and benefits calculations . It is dedicated to a range of  city attributes 
and variables related to population and land use, electricity consumption mix,  health 
information, electricity generation, and mobili ty emissions factors. While default inputs are 
present in the tool (based on assumptions listed below), a s shown in Figure 5, city-specific 
inputs entered in the yellow cells for each attribute are preferred.  
Figure 5. Screenshot of the City Data tab, where users input general city information 
 
Note: The data sheet includes cells for both city-specific user input (preferred) and pre-loaded 
default inputs based on the previously designated city typology. Source: WRI

15 
 
Input (Data input sheet - ‘City Data’) 
 
 Population (number of people): This contains the population of the city in 2020.  
 Average annual population growth rate, today-2050 (percentage): The average rate 
at which the population grows every year. This percentage is sensitive , and the user 
input will have a significant impact on results.  
 Population Density (residents/km2): The density is based on the number of residents 
within the defined municipal area of the city . This is an input from the “Initial Data 
Input.” 
 Emissions per capita  (MTCO2/year): The annual regional median per capita  
emissions, BASIC, GHG emissions from stationary electricity, transportation and waste 
(“C40 : Greenhouse Gas Protocol for Cities Interactive Dashboard” n.d.) 
 Electricity mix (percentage of electric ity generated in M Wh from each source) : The 
electricity mix of the grid currently available in the selected city and expected or desired 
mix in the future . The final results will vary d epending on whether the user inputs 
expected or desired mix.  
 Electricity generation emission s (kg/MWh per each generation source) : List of 
emission factors for electricity generation pollutants - CO2, PM 10, and NO x emissions 
based on fuel type. 
 ICE vehicles emission factors; (kg/km): List of emission factors for ICE combustion 
engine pollutants - CO2 PM10, and NOx emissions based on vehicle mode. 
City General Default Input Assumptions (Default input – ‘City Default’) 
 
 Population: The default average annual population growth rate from 2020 -2050 is 
2.3% for emerging economies and 0.5% for developed economie s based on (United 
Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, and Population Division 2019) 
 Average annual population growth rate, today-2050 (percentage): The average rate 
at which the population grows every year. These rates are based on the World 
Urbanization Prospects 2018 projections that incorporate data from 1950 and project 
out to 2050 (United Nations 2019). 
 Population Density (residents/km2): The density is based on the number of residents 
within the defined municipal area of the city. This is an input from the “Initial Data 
Input.” 
 Climate information: By default, “Hot” is considered above 35C (95F) while “Cold” is 
considered below -6C (20F).  
 Emission per capita: Based on the city location, the default regional median per capita 
emissions per year is sourced from (“C40 : Greenhouse Gas Protocol for Cities 
Interactive Dashboard” n.d.) 
 Electricity mix : The city is  categorized as Dirty, Moderate , or Low-Carbon based on 
current and projected electricity mix data input from the user. It is assumed that the 
electricity on the grid will get cleaner with time. The tool provides analysis of different 
potential future scenarios, not business as usual projections.

Source: Authors assumption, estimated based on (Kennedy, Stewart, and Westphal 2019)  
 Electricity generation emissions : The default Emission factors for coal, natural gas , 
and oil are sourced from IPCC 2006 Emission Fact ors, (Mawdsley et al., n.d.)  and 
(Comission for Environmental Cooperation 2015) . These are global averages. By 
default, the electricity generation emission factors only consider in-site generation and 
not life-cycle value. It is assumed that the following electricity generation types have 
zero pollutant emission factors: Solar, Wind, Hydro and Nuclear. 
 ICE vehicles emission factors : The default emission factors by pollutant and vehicle 
type are sourced from (Yang and Bandivadekar, n.d.) , (UNEP 2018) , (Song 2017) , 
(Victoria Transport Policy Institute 2018) , and (Cooper et al. 2019b) . All shared fleet 
vehicles are assumed to have the same emission factors as private cars.   
2.2.2 Mobility 
In this section the user is provided with the ability to explore different future scenarios  by 
defining future modal split and EV up take into 2035 and 2050.  For the year 2020 , tool users 
input the total number of vehicles (ICE and EV) operating in the city; these inputs used to define 
the city’s average daily VKT and the projected vehicle populations in the city for 2035 and 2050.  
Within the tool there are five vehicle modes considered:  
 Private cars: owned and used by private residents or households. 
 Private two -wheelers: privately owned and operated motorized two -wheeled 
vehicles, does not include human-powered bicycles. 
 Shared fleets: owned by businesses or cities (public)  and used for taxi services, on -
demand rides, ridesharing, or car rentals. In the FMC, shared fleets are classified as cars. 
Generally, they are the same size as private cars, but with higher utilization rates. 
 Public buses: part of the city public transit system  
 Rail: includes subway, light rail, tram, cable-car, regional train, etc.

Mobility Input (Data input sheet - ‘Mobility Data’; Default information – ‘Mobility Default’)  
 
 Modal split , 2035 and 2050  (% motorized vehicle utilization  by mode ): The 
breakdown of travel between different modes including private cars, public buses, 
shared fleets, and rail. While modal split can be measured in a variety of ways (such as 
vehicle distance traveled, passenger distance traveled, or number of trips for the years 
2035 and 2050), in this tool we calculate  modal split by the percentage breakdown of 
commuters’ predominant (i.e., longest distance)  mode. For 2020 , the modal split is 
calculated based on the total number of vehicles input by the user, and by the ridership 
information provided by the user for public transportation . User input  can have a 
significant impact on the vehicle numbers in the future. Users should keep  modal split 
measurements the same across all sources.  
 Total ICE vehicles 2020  (no. of  vehicles): For each mode, the total number of 
registered ICE vehicles operating within a city for 2020. If possible, this input should be 
sourced from vehicle registrations. This is NOT the total number of vehicles in a city. If 
using a value that is the total number of vehicles in a city, please subtract  out the  
number of EVs  in the city.  Additionally, ple ase ensure shared vehicles, taxis and 
transportation network company (TNC) vehicles, are counted separately from the total 
number of total private vehicles. As with EVs, TNCs will likely need to be subtracted 
from the total number of registered vehicles gi ven that they are not registered 
separately. Despite the fact that many TNC drivers operate on multiple platforms, all 
TNC vehicle numbers should be counted as individual drivers  because it is not public 
knowledge which drivers have dual -registrations. Almost all calculations are based off 
registered vehicle numbers in some way, so users should be careful when inputting 
these numbers. For private vehicles, if available, user can input only the number of ICE 
vehicles which are used on a daily basis  (not all of the registered vehicles), if they (1) 
also input this information for EVs, and (2)  use an average occupancy per vehicle (see 
below) which only includes vehicles used daily.

18 
 
 Total EVs 2020  (no. of vehicles): For each mode,  the total number of registered EVs 
(fully battery electric vehicles) operating in a city for 2020. This input should be sourced 
from vehicle registrations. This tool is designed for fully battery electric ve hicles and 
not for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs).  For private vehicles, i f available, user 
can input only the number of  EVs which are used on a daily basis (not all of the 
registered vehicles), if they (1) also input this information for ICE vehicles, and (2) use 
an average occupancy per vehicle (see below) which only includes vehicles used daily. 
 Uptake of EVs , 2035 and 2050  (% EVs): For each mode, the p ercentage of total 
vehicles targeted to be electric in a city  for the years 2035 and 2050 . These numbers 
are based on the goals put forward by the city. For 2020, this value is already calculated 
from the values input for “Total ICE vehicles 2020” and “Total EVs 2020.” 
 Average trip length (km/trip): For all modes excluding public bus and rail, the average 
distance traveled per trip taken by a vehicle. For buses, this is average trip length. The 
average trip length will have a significant impact on the charging infrastructure outputs.  
 Average number of trips  per day per vehicle (trips/day): For all modes excluding 
public bus and rail, the average quantity of trips taken per day  per vehicle. These data 
are commonly collected in household travel surveys. 
 Average occupancy per registered vehicle  (passengers/vehicle): For all modes 
excluding public bus and rail , the average number of users in a vehicle. This number 
includes the average across all registered vehicles, including those which are not used 
daily. This number is a standard metric of shared mobility vehicles. For private cars and 
two-wheelers, this number can be estimated by taking the average occupancy for a 
vehicle on the road (a metric commonly kept by cities) and reducing it by the percentage 
of vehicles which are not used for everyday travel (this can be estimated based on the 
percentage of households with 3 or more vehicles, which is a common metric recorded 
in household travel surveys). Alternatively, users can also input the average occupancy 
per vehicle on the road, if they input the number of vehicles used daily above (as 
opposed to inputting the total number of registered vehicles above). This number is 
highly sensitive. Changing occupancy from 1 pa ssenger to 2 passengers can cut the 
number of total vehicles in half.   
 Average l ifespan of ICE vehicles  (years): For all modes excluding rail , the average 
vehicle lifespan of an ICE vehicle.  
 Average l ifespan of e -vehicles (years): For all modes excluding rail , the average 
vehicle lifespan of an EV. 
 Public bus a nnual vehicle revenue kilometers , 2020  (km): For public buses only. 
This information is typically provided in annual reports from the local transit agency. If 
a region has several agencies,  use information from an aggregated source (preferred, 
such as from a regional planning entity) or from  the largest agency in the region  (if 
necessary). Ideally, this information would represent just revenue miles traveled, but 
total VKT will suffice. This information may be given on a per -bus basis; if so, use that 
information to calculate the total annual VKT for all buses together. 
 Public bus and rail annual ridership, 2020 (no. of riders): For both public buses and 
rail, the annual ridership numbers on that transit system. This information is typically 
provided in annual reports from the local transit agency. If a region has several agencies, 
use information from an aggregated source (preferred, such as from a regional planning

19 
 
entity) or from the largest agency in the region (if necessary).  Ideally this information 
will include linked trips as one rider, but unlinked trip data will suffice as well. 
 Average annual population growth rate, today-2050 (%): From City Input. 
Mobility Default Input Assumptions 
 Modal split, 2035 and 2050 : The default modal split for 2035 and 2050 is 
automatically filled in with the same modal split that is calculated in 2020 based on the 
vehicle numbers. If users want to change their modal split, they will need to  manually 
input their own projections. If mode split is manually entered, it should be broken down 
by the predominant mode (i.e., the mode used for the longest distance) for each user of 
multimodal trips. 
 Uptake of EVs, 2035 and 2050: The default uptake of EVs is based on U.S. market share 
indications from the Edison Electric Institute’s EV Sales 2019 report and mode share 
projections from the IEA’s 2018 Global EV Outlook report (Edison Electric Institute 
2019; IEA 2018) 
 Average trip length : By default , EVs and ICE vehicles have the same unit distance 
traveled, and they are the only two types of engines (for simplification purposes). While 
EV drivers have been found to travel less miles than ICE drivers, it assumed that ICE 
vehicles and EVs have the same average trip length and number of trips per day and the 
same VKT for each mode (Boston and Werthman 2016). For shared fleets, the default 
trip length only accounts for distance traveled with a passenger in the vehicle. 
Deadheading, drivers traveling without passengers, is not taken into account.  
 Average number of trips per day per vehicle: The average number of trips per day is 
calculated based on the CURB database from (The World Bank 2016). Private cars and 
private two-wheelers are assumed to have the same number of trips per day. Literature 
reveals that the number of trips taken by an individual correlates with economic activity 
(Blumenberg et al. 2012; Litman 2020) . Therefore, the number of trips is assumed 
higher in developed economies than in emergin g economies.  Determining t he 
difference between high-income and low-income trips per day is an imperfect science, 
and a simple binary variable is used between these two income levels, based on author’s 
assumptions. Literature is inconsistent on whether future trends will dictate more or 
less trips per person. Therefore, t he average number of trips are expected to remain 
constant between the different years. 
 Average occupancy per registered vehicle : In general, shared fleets ha ve higher 
occupancy rates than private vehicles (UNEP 2018; Schaller 2018) . Private cars are 
assumed to have lower occupancy  than other modes  (UNEP 2018; Schaller 2018) . 
Private vehicle occupancy is based on national data in the US, which is then reduced by 
24% to account for all registered vehicles (not just occupancy of vehicles on the road. 
The 24% reduction is based on the 24% of US households that have three or more 
vehicles (Center for Sustainable Systems 2019) . The default inputs do not change 
overtime.  
 Average lifespan of ICE vehicles: The default average lifespan for all modes does not 
change over time  or by economy type. The average lifespans come from the following 
reports: IAEE Report 2014, Nationwide Insurance 2017, US DoT.

20 
 
 Average lifespan of e -vehicles: The default average lifespan for all modes does not 
change over time. The average lifespans come from the following reports: (US DOE n.d.), 
BYD Warranty, UNEP 2018. 
 Public bus annual vehicle revenue kilometers, 2020: No default alternative listed in the 
tool. 
 Public bus and rail annual ridership, 2020: No default alternative listed in the tool.

2.2.3 Charging Infrastructure 
Electricity consumption calculation and estimation are an important component for calculating 
a city’s  charging infrastructure requirements and the emissions associated with vehicle 
electricity use. For electricity usage , two main variables  are considered : 1) VKT and 2)  an 
environmental factor which adjusts that estimate by considering average temperature s of the 
city, which can impact battery efficiency.  
The FMC assumes that EV operators can charge at four different location types:  
 Home: residential charging setting 
 Work: charging located at a place of employment 
 Public: charging locations accessible for public use 
 Depot: charging locations for fleets, most commonly not accessible to the public 
The FMC assumes that there are six different charger types that EVs can use to charge.  This is 
broken down between LDVs and HDVs, each vehicle class is associated with three charger types. 
Charger power values (kW) listed below should be used as reference values, the terminology 
used to describe different kW  ranges can vary  by geography  (International Energy Agency 
2019). 
LDV Charging 
 Level 1: Most commonly found in home charging settings and facilitated by a wall outlet, 
either 120V or 240V depending on geography. Charging power is less than 3.7 kW.  
 Level 2: Most commonly found in public, private, and work charging settings. Charging 
power can range between 3.7 kW and 22 kW. 
 Level 3: Almost exclusively found in public or depot charging settings. Charging power 
is above 50 kW, but no greater than 400 kW. 
HDV Charging 
 Slow chargers: Most commonly found in depot settings. Charging power capabilities can 
range between 22 kW and 60 kW 
 Fast chargers:  Most commonly found in depot settings.  Charging power capabilities 
range between 125 kW and 400 kW.

Note: The data sheet includes cells for both city-specific user input (preferred) and pre-loaded 
default inputs based on the previously designated city typology. Source: WRI 
Charging Infrastructure Input (Data input sheet - ‘Charging Data’) 
 Battery capacity (kWh): Average battery capacity available in the city for each vehicle 
mode in the years 2020, 2035, and 2050. 
 Battery range (km): Maximum distance each vehicle mode can travel with the battery 
size defined in the battery capacity input.  
 Charger power (kW): The average power flow (kW) each EV charger type can supply 
to a vehicle in your city under normal circumstances. This input is sensitive and has an 
impact on charger numbers.  
 Charging infrastructure li fespan (years): Number of years each charger type will 
continue to function properly assuming regular maintenance and usage habits.  
 Charger user behavior  (by mode, % charging location ): Percentage of time during a 
given day (out of 24 hours) that each mode will utilize each location to charge the 
vehicle battery. For each vehicle mode, the user behavior at each associated charging 
setting should add to 100%.  Current, expected, or desired charging behavior of EV 
owners when charging their vehicles can be applied to this variable by the user. 
 Charger utilization rate  (% charging location ): Percentage in a given day (out of 24 
hours) that a charger will be operating and plugged into a vehicle per charging location 
(home, work, public, depot charging).  
 Distribution of charging type (by location, % charger type ): The distribution of 
charging speeds type that exists  within a defined  charging location type . For each 
charging setting, the percent of each charging speed present should collectively add to

26 
 
100 percent. Current, expected or desired available charging infrastructure type/level 
by location in your city.  
 Environmental factor (percent): Percentage of operation al loss and impact to vehicle 
battery efficiencies due to presence of extreme temperatures. This is determined by the 
selection made within the tool’s “Initial Data Entry” tab. 
Charging Infrastructure Default Input Assumptions (Default information – ‘Charging Default’)  
 Battery range (km): By default,  the battery range is projected to increase over time 
based on current trends (IEA 2020). Battery range and battery capacity are assumed to 
increase at similar rates in the default settings.  
 Charger power (kW): This default input data considers various levels of charging for 
both light duty vehicles (Level1; Level 2; Level 3) and heavy -duty vehicles (Slow 
charging; Fast charging) (Nicholas, Lutsey, and Hall 2019; Proterra 2019) . Future 
projections are based on the rationale that  charging capacity is projected to increase 
over time. Therefore, it is assumed that there is a desire to access to faster chargers, so 
charging power increases over time. 
 Charging infrastructure lifespan  (years): The default  input data considers multiple 
charger settings and for relevant charging levels available within each setting (Smith 
and Castellano 2015; Chang et al. 2012).   
 Charger user behavior (by mode, % charging location): The default input data is based 
on IRENA smart charging projections and trends observed by the US DOE and ICCT (Hall 
and Lutsey 2020; US DOE n.d.; IRENA 2019) . It assumes that  vehicles are charged to 
100% each ti me they are plugged in for charging. It also assumes that, t hrough time, 
home charging for private vehicles will decrease, while work and public charging 
increase. For shared fleets, home charging is assumed to decrease through time as depot 
charging incre ases. For public buses, charging is assumed to  always take place in a 
depot given that opportunity charging is a nascent technology. 
 Charger utilization rate  (% charging location) : Based on research done on public 
charging trends and the speed of chargers, utilization rate is assumed to start at 30% of 
the day in places that serve private vehicles (home and work) . 30% is roughly 8 hours 
which corresponds to an average workday or an average night  (IRENA 2019) . The 
author assumes this percentage will decrease slightly through time (20% by 2050) for 
home charging based on (1) an increase in charger speed and (2) a n increase in public 
and depot charging, especially for shared fleets (Wolbertus, Van den Hoed, and Maase 
2016; Wolbertus et al . 2018). Electricity consumption is also assumed to  continue to 
increase with time (IEA 2019). 
 Distribution of charging type (by location, % charger type): The default percentages 
are based on the percentages of each level of charger currently a vailable globally (IEA 
2020). Future trends are based on the following: 
o Home charging for both level 1 and 2 chargers are assumed to grow in the model 
at the same rate as private vehicles (electric cars and two -wheelers) initially, 
however home charging is expected to decrease as the utilization of charging 
infrastructure in the workplace and public spaces increases (Engel et al. 2018). 
We are not assuming that buying an EV means you purchased a home charger, 
so the number of level 1 chargers will likely be lower than the number of private 
vehicles.

27 
 
o In the case of workplace chargers, level 2 chargers are expected to grow more 
rapidly at the beginning due to government incentive programs and then grow 
steadily. In parallel, level 3 chargers will grow steadily as it is primarily 
deployed in the public space due to higher installation and operational cost but 
faster cha rging speed. As volumes and infrastructure increase, the costs will 
reduce and make level 3 viable for workplace charging as well.  
o Public charging may vary depending on the city type. In cities associated with 
developed economies, as public investment inc reases, level 2 chargers will be 
replaced with level 3 chargers. In emerging economies, we can expect both 
chargers to be in place simultaneously.   
 Environmental factor (percent): By default, this factor is assumed to be 1%, meaning 
that in “hot” or “cold ” climates batteries consume 1% more energy  (Motoaki, Yi, and 
Salisbury 2018; Hawkins 2019).

This equation assumes that for each charger type at each charging location, those sochargers 
will be used uniformly throughout the day. The number of chargers needed is a function of the

present at that location can facilitate given its associated charger utilization rate , which is a 
percentage of 24 hours.

Doubling the consumption will roughly double the final electricity cost for all vehicles.  
Cost Default Input Assumptions (Default information – ‘Cost Default’)

33 
 
All cost default values are in USD 2020 (based on rates in February 2020). 
 Average E-Vehicle investment cost by battery size (thousand USD 2020):  
o Default input data for cars is calculated based on estimates from EIA (2017) and 
IDB (2016). 
o Default input data for two wheelers is calculated based on estimates from Shu 
(2019); Hinton (2018); Zero Motorcycles; and Muoio (2017).  
o Default input data for buses is calculated based on estimates from  Bloomberg 
New Energy Finance (2018) and Reuters (2017). 
o In real terms, the default input values assume vehicle costs fall at 10% over a 
15-year period due to improvements in technology and increase in sales 
volume. 
o For ease of calculation, the cost of a shared fleet vehicle is assumed to be the 
same as the cost of a private car.  
 Average cost of vehicle investment for ICE vehicles (thousand USD 2020):  
o Default input data for all modes are ca lculated based on estimates from  UNEP 
(2018). 
o In real terms, the default input values assume vehicle costs fall at 10% over a 
15-year period due to improvements in technology and increase in sales 
volume. 
o For ease of calculation, the cost of a shared fleet vehicle is assumed to be the 
same as the cost of a private car.  
 Average E-Vehicle maintenance cost per vehicle mode per battery size (USD 2020 Cost 
per km):  
o Default input data for cars is calculated based on estimates from Berman (2018) 
and Edmunds (2020). 
o Default input data for two wheelers is calculat ed based on estimates from  
(UNEP 2018). 
o Default input data for buses is calculated based on estimates from Mickle, Siegel, 
and Sutton  and FTA (2018). 
o The maintenance cost per EV mode is the same, independent of the battery size.   
o Assumed decrease of 50% in EV maintenance cost in developing economies due 
to cheaper labor compared to developed economies. This is assuming the major 
portion of the maintenance cost comes from labor based on Antich (2018). 
 Average cost of vehicle maintenance for ICE vehicles (USD 2020, Cost per km):  
o Default input data  for cars and two wheelers  is calculated based on estim ates 
from Lutsey and Nicholas (2018). 
o Default input data for buses is calculated based on estimates from FTA (2018). 
 Public investment by investment asset (percentage):  
o The default values assume a 5% public investment per year for a private car in 
2020 based on information from this US Energy Information Administration 
report (EIA 2017) . The public investment in shared fleet vehicles and two -
wheelers are based on car numbers. For buses, public investment is assumed to 
be 100%.  
o Public investment for charging infrastructure includes total cost for public  
chargers and existing policy incentives for private ones (Slowik et al. 2019).

34 
 
o Public investment decreases in vehicles by 1% over a 15 -year period in 
developed economies and by 3% over a 15 -year perio d in developing 
economies as vehicles become cheaper with increased adoption and lower 
battery prices. The assumptions are based on insights in IEA (2020). 
o Public investment increases in charging infrastructure by 30% over a 30 -year 
period as charging infrastructure increases drastically to overcome barriers to 
EV adoption, especially as more expensive DC fast charging infrastructure 
increases in the public and at the workplace (through incentives and subsidies) 
(Slowik et al. 2019). 
o The public investment in shared fleets is assumed to be double of cars as it 
includes private and publicly owned fleets. Public investment in shared fleets is 
the percentage of total cost paid by public institutions to subsidize fleet 
purchase. Shared fleets are cars owned either publicly (city-owned) or privately 
(Uber, Lyft, etc.).  
 Electricity transmission (USD 2020 per charger):  
o Electricity transmission costs cover the cost of transmission and distribution 
and are a fixed cost, based on retail electricity bills.  Future cost scenarios for 
2035 and 2050  are calculated based on impacts from GDP rate increase 
(Cambridge Econometrics 2018). 
o The electricity transmission cost for islands is assumed to be 10% higher cost 
due to the isolated nature of island states and added infrastruct ure to transmit 
electricity. 
o The tool uses values estimated from Cambridge Econometrics (2018). 
o Electricity transmission costs do not consider Level 1 chargers as they are 
connected to the existing residential grid infrastructure. 
 Charging infrastructure cost (thousand USD 2020):  
o Charging station infrastructure cost decrease by 20% over a 15-year period as 
volume of infrastructure deployment increases causing manufacturing and 
installation costs to reduce. It includes cost of each charger type including 
installation costs (labor, materials, permits) (Agenbroad 2014; Bloomberg New 
Energy Finance 2018). 
 Electricity consumption cost (USD 2020 per kWh):  
o Electricity consumption prices increase at a 10% rate over a 15 -year period 
based on information EuroStat electricity prices for household consumers  
(Eurostat 2020).

be purchased per year  assuming the number of vehicles increases at a constant rate . The 
calculations are split between 2020 -2035 and 2035 -2050 to account for different adoption 
rates.

2.2.5 Emissions 
For the Emissions Calculations, the tailpipe emission of e-vehicles is 0. The emissions generated 
by the electricity production for charging are included. The emission factors estimations in this 
tool are related only to tailpipe and electricity generation . We do not consider emissions from 
braking and tire friction  in this version of the FMC . Additionally, the tool does not account for 
carbon produced during manufacturing.  
 
Figure 12. Emissions Calculations use input data from City Input and Mobility Input.  
Outputs produced in the Mobility Calculations and Electric Infrastructure Calculation sheets are 
also used. 
 
Emissions Inputs (Data input sheet - ‘City Data’) 
 Average vehicle trips per day: from Mobility Input 
 Average trip length: from Mobility Input 
 ICE emissions factor: from City Input 
 Total km per vehicle mode: from Mobility Calculations 2. 
 Pollutant emission for electricity generation by source: from City Input 
 EV distance travelled by vehicle mode: from Mobility Calculations 2. 
Emissions Assumptions (Default information – ‘City Default’) 
 I ICE vehicle emission factors are taken primarily from US EPA (2008) and Song 
(2017).  Because fuel economy standards (EURO I-V) do not exist in every country, they 
are not considered in this version of the FMC. The tool assumes that emission factors 
are constant over time. Users are encouraged to update the data with more 
geographically or temporally relevant data when inputting their data.  
 All low-carbon electricity sources (the tool includes wind, solar, hydro, nuclear) are 
assumed to have zero emissions for electricity generation. 
 We assume shared fleets to have the same emissions factors as private cars.

2.2.6 Benefits 
The benefits calculations put the emissions reductions in context by quantifying the social 
costs avoided by switching to EVs. In this section, the user cannot input information directly

45 
 
and will be using the default input data to assess benefit impacts. This is done to simplify 
calculations and align data sources.  
The factors determining the “value of social cost” are complex and vary by emission type and 
source. The sources and estimations for social cost used in this tool is available in Annex 2. 
These values are subjective in nature and are only intended to provide a general estimate for 
initial planning purposes. 
 
Benefit Input (Default information – ‘Benefits Default’) 
 Emissions social cost factors (SCFs) (USD 2020/kg): the social cost of key pollutants 
(CO2, PM10, PM2.5. NOx) per kilogram emitted based on the Social Cost Factor (SCF).  
 ICE emissions factors  (kg/km): the amount of key pollutants emitted per km of 
different ICE vehicle classes.  
 EV emissions factors  (kg/km): the amount of key pollutants emitted per km of 
different EV classes. 
 Total emission reduction per pollutant  (kg/year): the total reduction of poll utants 
caused by electrifying vehicles as calculated by Emissions section.  
 Total ICE vehicles: the total number of ICE vehicles existing in a city  sourced from 
Mobility Calculations. 
 Total EVs: the total number existing in a city as calculated by Mobility Calculations. 
 Vehicle Kilometers travelled: (km/day): the number of kilometers each vehicle mode 
travels each day in a city calculated by Mobility Calculations. 
Benefits Default Input Assumptions 
 
 Emissions social cost factors (SCFs) (USD 2020/kg):  
o All SCFs come from (Victoria Transport Policy Institute 2018) and the Transport 
Emissions & Social Cost Assessment Tool  (Su 2017). (details are available in

3 Conclusion 
The FMC is designed to help cities analyze the impact of their future electrification plans. Cities 
around the world have  set ambitious goals for electrifying their vehicle fleets, but few cities 
have prudently analyzed the impacts (both positive and negative) and requirements that these 
EVs will bring.  These electrification objectives depend on evidence-based planning. Planning, 
in turn, requires solid estimates of the expected costs and benefits, such as those provided 
through the FMC.  Through the FMC, cities around the world will have a new tool to help them 
intelligently navigate their own planning processes. 
The FMC is a tool that, for a given range of city -specific inputs, estimates the costs, 
requirements, and benefits of different electrification scenarios. While these data points are 
critical for planning and gaining political support for electrification, the tool does have some 
limitations. For example, the FMC is not intended for (nor does it provide) a comparative cost-
benefit analysis against other propulsion technologies such as diesel or CNG. The tool is also 
not designed to provide guidance on what percentage of vehicle fleets should be electrified in 
future plans; rather the tool provides analysis on the costs and benefits of scenarios which are 
predefined by the user. Furthermore, like any model, the FMC is only as good as its underlying 
inputs. If users are unable to provide robust city-specific inputs, the results may not be directly 
applicable to their city. If users understand intended use of FMC, they can leverage this tool to 
quantitatively enhance EV planning in their city. 
Early iterations of this tool were tested with scenarios from Beijing, Bogota, and Delhi, and the 
authors found results to be reasonable.  
Future iterations of this tool may consider adding spatial analysis  to identify appropriate 
locations for chargers, impacts of electrifying urban freight vehicles and inclusion of non -
exhaust emissions to capture the overall emissions impact if the share of energy mix  
(renewable energy source v/s fossil-fuel based source) in the city changes.  
While the FMC is not a panacea for EV planning and analysis, it does allow cities to understand 
the real -world implications of enacting EV policies.  EV a doption is critical to help combat 
climate change and clear urban air of local pollution; however, it represents a new and daunting 
challenge. The FMC can help cities navigate these obstacles as they sail off into the uncharted 
waters of vehicle electrification.

Annex 
Annex 1     
Integrated into the FMC are four city typologies. Each city type is linked to a set of default inputs. 
These default inputs are broad generic estimations intended to fill informational gaps in a user’s 
city-specific input data. Two primary variables were used to develop the four typologies:  
 Population density 
 GDP per capita 
Each city typology is defined by a range of values associated with these variables. The city types 
developed from this are  
(1) emerging economy – high density  
(2) developed economy – low density,  
(3) developed economy – high density, and  
(4) emerging economy – low density.  
City density is informed by population densities. GDP per capita informs whether the city is an 
emerging or developed economy. The attributes of each City Type are defined in Table A1.

purchasing power parity rate s. An international dollar has the same purchasing power over 
GDP as the U.S. dollar has in the United States. GDP at purchaser's prices is the sum of gross 
value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes and minus any 
subsidies not included in the value of the products. It is calculated without making deductions 
for depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and degradation of natural resources. Data

Annex 2  
Social cost assessment 
The social cost of pollutants is the measure, in a certain currency, of the long-term damage done 
by a ton of each pollutant emissions each year. Each pollutant derived from motor vehicles 
produce different harm to the environment and human health. While some are local or regional 
impacts, in other cases the location is less important.

The monetary assessment of the selected pollutant does not account for the impact on health 
as this impact is separa tely evaluated in the previous section. We have selected  values from 
Victoria Transport Policy Institute 2018 (VTPI). VTPI converted original values from different 
publications to 2007 USD, adjusted based on the CPI, and the authors inflated them further to 
2020.

The value of social cost for CO2eq is originally sourced by UK 
Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs - AEA 
Technology Environment (2005) and included in table 5.10.4 -
14 in Victoria Transport Policy Institute (2018). This number 
represents the upper bound estimate of the abovementioned 
sources, since this figure was on par with other estimates in 
other major sources (such as Downing et al. [2005] who 
indicate this figure is well within one standard deviation of the 
average estimates).  This number was converted from dollars

to 2020 USD.  
PM10 Per 
kg 
The value of social cost for PM10 is originally sourced by 
Rowan Williams Davies and Irwin Inc (RWDI) (2006) and 
included in table 5.10.4-1 in Victoria Transport Policy Institute 
(2018). Since it is difficult to find reliable and robust sources 
for information on the value of the social cost associated with 
PM10, this figure represents a number provided for PM2.5, 
which was converted to PM10 by dividing by a conversion 
factor of 0.6, based on WHO (2014). This number was 
converted from dollars per ton to dollars per kilogram and then 
adjusted for inflation to 2020 USD.  
PM2.5 Per 
kg 
The value of social cost for PM2.5 is originally sourced by 
Rowan Williams Davies and Irwin Inc (RWDI) (2006) and 
included in table 5.10.4-1 in Victoria Transport Policy Institute 
(2018). This number was converted from dollars per ton to 
dollars per kilogr am and then adjusted for inflation to 2020 
USD.  
NOX Per 
kg 
The value of social cost for NOx is originally sourced by AEA 
Technology Environment (2005) and included in table 5.10.4-1 
in Victoria Transport Policy Institute (2018). This number was 
converted from dollars per ton to dollars per kilogram and then 
adjusted for inflation to 2020 USD.
