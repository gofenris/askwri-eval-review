ABSTRACT
The aim of Financial Analysis of Charging station (FACt) (the “Tool”) is to help 
build an understanding of the business case for rolling out public charging 
infrastructure for electric vehicles (EVs) in India in different contexts. The 
MS-Excel-based tool is a flexible, transparent, and user-friendly solution to 
the problem of conducting a quick preliminary assessment of the financial 
justification for setting up a public charging station (PCS). The wide-ranging 
outputs from the Tool provide a well-rounded view of the financials of a 
public charging infrastructure project, including the project cost composition 
and the possible impact of various factors on the return. Currently, there 
is no publicly available open access application-based solution, made for 
the Indian market, that achieves the stated goals of FACt. The model is 
particularly useful for entities that are interested in gaining a foundational 
understanding of PCS finances in India, such as financial institutions, 
policymakers/regulators, real estate companies, urban local bodies, and 
implementing agencies. It is designed to allow several implementation 
situations and charging use cases spanning the gamut of technological, 
operational, financial, and regulatory aspects to be accounted for in the 
financial calculation. Cities in India can benefit from FACt as it can help them 
identify the financial barriers to private sector deployment of PCSs, enabling 
stakeholders to design policies to overcome them.
INTRODUCTION
Motivation
The availability of adequate public charging infrastructure is widely  
considered a prerequisite for EV adoption (IEA 2022a). To this end, the 
central government and subnational governments in India have emphasized 
rolling out public charging points. Financial incentives have been offered to 
encourage the setting up of public chargers for EVs. The government has 
advocated setting up at least one charging point in every 3 km by 3 km grid in 
a city to allay range anxiety (Ministry of Power–GoI

 2022). Despite the policy push, on-ground implementation of 
public charging infrastructure has not seen much traction. 
One of the major causes of this slow progress is the high-risk 
perception of the investment. There is a perceived uncertainty 
around the business case for establishing and running a PCS.1 
This is often attributed to factors such as the high up-front 
investment in charging equipment and the ancillary electrical 
setup, expensive space rental in cities, uncompetitive electricity 
tariffs for EV charging, the additional cost of operators to staff 
the facility, and suboptimal asset utilization due to the lack of 
charging demand (The World Bank 2021; Sandalkhan et al. 
2021; IEA 2022b; Singh 2021; Das and Banerjee 2022; Pathak 
and Patel 2021). 
The nascency of the electric mobility sector, its fast-evolving 
technological and business landscapes, and the different  
charging use cases2 make it difficult to templatize the 
implementation mechanisms. It is evident that no silver bullet 
can make investment in public charging infrastructure attractive. 
A range of policy or regulatory interventions along with a fresh 
take on the tender clauses may be necessary. These efforts will 
need to strike a balance between the interests of the parties 
involved in the implementation of PCSs, especially the charge 
point operator (CPO),3 the electricity distribution utility, and 
the land-owning entity. 
To this end, it is critical to build an understanding of the business 
case for setting up a PCS in applicable contexts and different 
charging use cases. The present understanding of the financials of 
a public charging infrastructure project for many stakeholders 
in the sector, other than the established charging service 
providers, is largely superficial and liable to be influenced by 
market commentary and the gray literature.4 The need thus 
arises to empower these actors with a freely available, open 
access resource that can help decode the financial performance 
of an investment in PCS deployment and also yield insights 
into the associated financial aspects. A simple, user-friendly tool 
can help build the capacity of the stakeholders, who may not 
have the expertise to appreciate and deal with the problem. No 
open access tool for this purpose that is suitable for India’s EV 
sector is available in the public domain. The current solutions 
are primarily developed for advanced economies.5 Importantly, 
the dynamics of electric mobility markets vary considerably 
from one major economy to another. The variation can be 
seen in aspects such as the profiles of EV stock and charging 
patterns, types of charging units deployed and the entailed 
costs, electricity pricing and supply regulations, provision for 
land, personnel cost, charging fees, applicable rates for taxes and 
interest on loans, and inflation. Hence, it is critical to capture
the state of play unique to a country. A bespoke analytical 
solution thus needs to be developed for the Indian market.
Objectives of FACt
FACt, the Excel-based tool presented here, is a flexible,  
transparent, and user-friendly solution to the problem of  
conducting a quick preliminary assessment of the financial  
justification for setting up a PCS in India. The wide-ranging 
outputs from FACt provide a well-rounded view of the  
financials of a public charging infrastructure project, including 
the project cost composition and the possible impact of  
various factors on the return. This Tool is primarily meant to 
help develop a foundational understanding of PCS finances. For 
in-depth financial analysis of an investment, the use of more 
extensive calculations using a suite of financial indicators is 
recommended. This application should not be considered a  
one-stop solution for investment decision-making.
FACt serves the aforementioned objectives by enabling the user 
to achieve the following:
 ▪ Understand the composition of the entailed cost of setting 
up and running a PCS.
 ▪ Estimate the possible project internal rate of return (project 
IRR) for a CPO (see Box 1). 
 ▪ Gauge the contributions of the key input variables to the 
project’s net cash inflow. 
 ▪ Undertake sensitivity (what-if ) analysis to assess impacts of 
changes in specific input variables on the project IRR.
 ▪ Understand the changes in the values of input parameters 
needed to achieve the hurdle rate (see Box 2).
 ▪ Forecast over the project contract period the potential 
incomes of the stakeholders and the break-even year for the 
investment (see Box 3).
Box 1. What is the internal rate of return?
The internal rate of return (IRR) is the annual rate of growth that 
an investment is expected to generate. The higher the IRR, the 
more desirable the investment. However, before making an 
investment decision, one should also evaluate other financial 
metrics such as the net present value and debt-service 
coverage ratio.

TECHNICAL NOTE   |  March 2023  |  3
Financial Analysis of Charging station (FACt)
 ▪ It is a transparent application that helps the user perform 
analyses and gain insights into the different aspects of the 
charging business and its viability; all the assumptions and 
methods are clearly explained.
Although the user can use this tool to assess several  
implementation situations and charging use cases accurately, 
cases could occur in which certain aspects, especially those 
concerning new regulations and business models, might not be 
fully captured.
Potential use cases of FACt 
The model is expected to benefit entities interested in  
achieving a foundational understanding of PCS finances in 
India, such as financial institutions, policymakers/regulators, 
real estate companies, urban local bodies, and implementing 
agencies. Cities in India can benefit from FACt as it will help 
them identify financial barriers to private sector deployment 
of PCS, thus enabling stakeholders to design policies that 
may overcome them. The following are some of the specific 
use cases of FACt:
 ▪ An analyst in an early-stage start-up that is planning to 
venture into or is already in the business of providing EV 
charging services to customers can use this tool to quickly 
conduct a preliminary viability assessment of setting up a 
PCS in a certain context.
 ▪ An officer in a real estate company that is planning to 
rent out unused space to CPOs at its properties can apply 
FACt to identify a suitable rental mechanism and fix 
the rental rates.
 ▪ A loan officer of a retail bank can use FACt to get a 
sense of the financial outcome from a proposed charging 
infrastructure project for which a company has submitted an 
application for a loan.
 ▪ An officer of a nodal public agency, department, or ministry 
can use FACt to gauge the possible financial attractiveness to 
CPOs of deploying public charging infrastructure in a given 
policy and regulatory environment.
 ▪ An official of a city authority entrusted to design project 
tenders for installing and managing a PCS can use FACt to 
assess the viability of the projects and understand the impact 
of various tender clauses and site characteristics on the 
project financials. 
Uniqueness of the tool
FACt is one of its kind—currently, there is no publicly available 
open access application-based solution made for the Indian 
market that offers the functions of the Tool. Some of the key 
features of the Tool are the following: 
 ▪ It accounts for several implementation contexts covering 
technological, operational, financial, and regulatory aspects in 
the financial calculation.
 ▪ It is curated for the Indian context as it takes into account 
the mainstream EV chargers, electricity tariff framework and 
regulations, land arrangement, and other factors.
 ▪ The user has to provide a limited number of mandatory 
inputs. The default values (preloaded in the Tool) are 
customizable. Further, all data required to be entered are 
commonly available with the stakeholders.
 ▪ It offers flexibility, in that the user can consider various PCS 
configurations, CPO income mechanisms, types of electricity 
connections, tariff designs, and land rentals to account for 
different public charging use cases.
 ▪ It allows the user to benchmark the resulting project IRR 
and get a sense of the conditions required to achieve the 
targeted rate of return.
Box 2. What is the hurdle rate?
The hurdle rate is the minimum rate of return on an investment 
that will offset its costs. The hurdle rate is generally equal to the 
company’s cost of capital.
Box 3. What is breakeven?
Realizing breakeven in this case means that the aggregate  
revenue from the PCS (including the charging fee revenue, 
income from parking charges, and secondary net revenue) 
along with any financial support from the government to the 
project is able to match at a given point in time the cumulative 
cash outflow from the investment, which includes both the 
up-front capital expenditure (primarily on charging and 
ancillary infrastructure) and recurrent expenses (i.e., the cost of 
electricity, land rental, operator cost, and other operational and 
maintenance expenses) up to that time. The breakeven year is the 
year when breakeven is achieved.

Approach to the development of FACt
FACt was developed using a three-pronged approach: need 
assessment, tool conceptualization, and user feedback.
Need assessment
A series of interactions with stakeholders and an in-depth 
literature review were used to understand the major challenges 
in scaling up charging infrastructure rollout. A major gap  
was found in understanding the business viability of setting  
up a PCS. This gap has been slowing down on-ground  
implementation, as highlighted in the section titled “Motivation” 
(The World Bank 2021; Das and Banerjee 2022). The team 
also reached out to select players to understand how this  
possible knowledge gap could be bridged, and it was during 
the ensuing interactions that the idea of formulating an Excel-
based financial tool germinated.6 Subsequently, WRI India 
organized an EV Masterclass to socialize the concept of an 
Excel-based tool, which was well received by the participants 
and potential funders.7 These need assessment activities led 
to the formalization of the research initiative to develop 
FACt. Also, the target stakeholders (users of the Tool) were 
identified and invited to submit detailed feedback on FACt’s 
design and function.
Conceptualization of FACt
As ideated during the stakeholder consultation, Excel was 
found to be the best-suited platform for the application because 
of its popularity across a cross section of potential users, easy 
accessibility, sufficient flexibility, user-friendliness, and its 
comprehensive suite of functions. The need assessment helped 
identify the possible project financial indicators or target  
outputs. It was found that answers to the following key  
questions would help potential stakeholders:
 ▪ What would be the cumulative and operating costs 
of the project?
 ▪ How attractive would the project be under the 
given conditions?
 ▪ What major factors could impact the project’s 
business viability?
 ▪ What could be the possible financial impact of changes in 
the input (independent) variables or factors?
 ▪ What did the revenue trends for investors, distribution 
utilities, and land-owning entities (the three main actors 
associated in a project’s implementation) look like?
 ▪ What would it take to make the project financially viable?
Accordingly, the Tool provides the following major outputs:
 ▪ Cost dissection: This shows estimates of the total 
project cost, including the operating cost and the major 
cost components and sub-components over the 10-year 
project period.8
 ▪ Project IRR: This is a commonly applied indicator for 
evaluating the profitability of a potential investment, which 
is the core function of the Tool.
 ▪ Contributions of the key input parameters or variables: 
This output shows the contribution of key variables, such as 
the capital investment, charging fees, cost of electricity, land 
rental, cost of operator/crew, and average daily active  
use of charging units, to the project’s net cash inflow.
 ▪ Sensitivity (what-if ) analysis: This is used to predict 
possible changes in the project IRR value with ±10 and ±20 
percent variations in the values of the key input parameters 
compared to their original or baseline values.
 ▪ Revenue profiles: These show the projections of the possible 
yearly revenue trends for the CPO, the distribution utility, 
and the land-owning entity over the entire project duration.
 ▪ Solver analysis: This indicates how the key input parameters 
must be changed to achieve the benchmark or target 
rate of return.
User feedback on FACt
Extensive feedback from the identified potential users 
was central to the development of FACt, which was 
carried out in multiple stages. To seek specific feedback, 
detailed demonstrations of the draft Tool were given to the 
stakeholders,9 and several changes were made in the design and 
function of the draft Tool based on their inputs, which were 
documented for future reference. Moreover, the stakeholders 
were made part of a robust peer review exercise while advancing 
FACt from its beta version. FACt is thus the product of effective 
collaboration with its potential users. 
HOW TO USE FACt
The landing page of FACt titled “User Guide” provides 
instructions on how to use the Tool (Figure 1).
The Tool comprises a number of input pages and output  
or results worksheets. The input pages are used to feed the 
model with the required input data, and the output pages  
display the corresponding results. More details are given in 
the following sections.

Input pages
FACt mainly uses four categories of data: technological, 
operational, financial, and regulatory. These four sets of data are 
captured in two ways:
 ▪ User inputs: These are very context or case specific and 
hence must be provided by the user. FACt requires a 
limited number of such inputs, which makes the Tool quick 
and easy to use.
 ▪ Pre-set inputs: These are default values that are already 
preloaded in the Tool, but the user can change them 
depending on the context. The user does not have to collect 
and provide these input data unless the default values must 
be replaced with new inputs.
A short description of each of the input pages follows. Table 
A-1 in Appendix A gives the details (including the units of the  
concerned inputs, sources of input data collection, the purpose 
of the inputs, and specific guidance for users) of the input 
parameters. These details are also given in FACt. 
Financial Analysis of Charging station (FACt)
A Tool For Easy Financial Evaluation Of Public Charging Infrastructure Deployment In India
About the Tool:
The aim of FACt is to help the user conduct a quick preliminary assessment of the financial justification for setting up an electric vehicle (EV) public charging station (PCS) in India. The wide-rangingoutputs from the tool provide a well-rounded view of the
financials of a public charging infrastructure project, including the possible impact of different factors. This tool is primarily intended to help develop a foundational understanding of PCS finances. 
Why Use This Tool:
FACt enables the user to achieve the following:
1. Understand the composition of the entailed cost of setting up and running a PCS (see the "Cost Dissection" page). 
2. Estimate the possible project internal rate of return (project IRR+), which is the primary financial yardstick for evaluating the financial attractiveness of investing in a public charging infrastructure project (see the "Project IRR & Sensitivity" worksheet).
3. Gauge the contributions of the key input variables to the project’s net cash inflow (see the "Project IRR & Sensitivity" page).  
4. Undertake sensitivity (what-if) analysis in the ±10% and ±20% ranges, to show how changes in the given range in the values of individual independent variables affect the project IRR (the dependent variable; see the "Project IRR & Sensitivity" worksheet).    
 
5. Use the tool feature "Solver" to understand the changes in the values of the key input parameters needed to achieve the benchmark rate of return,also known as the hurdle rate (if the project IRR in the base case falls short of the target; see the    
    "Solver" page).    
6. Forecast over the 10-year project period the potential incomes of the stakeholders (i.e., the charge point operator [CPO], the power distribution utility, and the land-owning entity) that are directly involved in implementing a PCS (see the     "Revenue Profile" worksheet).
*As defined by the guidelines issued by the Ministry of Power or any other competent authority.
The internal rate of return (IRR) is the annual rate of growth that an investment is expected to generate. The higher an IRR, the more desirable the investment

User inputs 
Figure 2 shows a sample “User Inputs” page. Users can input 
data into this worksheet. For specific guidance on each input 
parameter, a user can hover the cursor on the concerned cell in 
the worksheet or refer to the “Input Data Table” page of the 
Tool or Table A-1 in Appendix A of this document. 
The following categories of data are covered by this 
input worksheet.
PCS CONFIGURATION, UTILIZATIONS, AND FEE RATES
 ▪ The user is required to input the number of charging units, the 
average daily active use of the charging unit in terms of hours, 
and the charging/swapping fees for the corresponding types of 
charging units. 
 ▪ The charging unit type signifies the type of charging 
solution deployed at the PCS (slow charger, moderately fast 
charger, fast charger, or a stack battery charging system for 
swappable batteries). 
 ▪ The eight EV charging solutions recognized in the guidelines 
issued by the Ministry of Power, GoI, on January 14, 2022, 
and commonly deployed at PCSs have been listed on this 
page. For details about these charging units, see the notified 
guidelines and their amendments.
 ▪ For the types of charging units that are not on the list, the 
user should provide the required inputs under the category 
“Other Charger Type” on both the input pages (i.e., “User 
Inputs” and “Pre-set Inputs”). 
 ▪ Importantly, FACt considers that the charging units are used 
at their rated output power levels. In reality, the effective 
power level during a charging session can fall below the rated 
power depending on the recommended C-rate of the EV’s 
battery (if a DC charging unit is used) and/or the power 
rating of the vehicle’s on-board charger (if an AC charging 
unit is used). 
PAYMENTS TO BE MADE TO THE DISTRIBUTION UTILITY
 ▪ The user is first required to input the energy charge and the 
demand charge, elements of the two-part tariff structure.
The energy charge is the variable component of the tariff 
and is linked to the recorded electricity consumption (kWh), 
energy charge is the variable component of the tariff and 
is linked to the recorded electricity consumption (kWh), 
whereas the demand charge is the fixed component of the 
tariff, its value depending on the sanctioned load or contract 
demand (kVA10) of the given electricity connection. For the 
energy charge, it is recommended to consider the landed 
cost or all-in rate of electricity (i.e., inclusive of taxes and 
other state-levied charges). Information on these charges11 
can be obtained from the state tariff orders for their serving 
distribution utilities, which are usually available on the 
websites of State Electricity Regulatory Commissions or the 
distribution utilities. 
 ▪ The user is then required to specify whether a new dedicated 
electricity connection is necessary to energize the PCS. A 
new dedicated electricity connection is typically required 
to take advantage of the preferential tariff (also known as 
the EV tariff ), if this benefit is offered by the electricity 
distribution utility. An existing connection can be used if the 
PCS is established on the premises of a host facility such as a 
workplace or shopping complex.
PAYMENTS TO BE MADE TO THE LAND-OWNING ENTITY
 ▪ The user is required to provide inputs under this category 
only if land rental is applicable. For instance, land rental 
may not be applicable for a shared workplace or residential 
charging use case as the concerned organization or the 
housing society is likely to own the land and offer space to 
the CPO free of charge to make cost of installation, and 
consequently the cost of service, economical. 
 ▪ In scenarios where a land rental is applicable, the user has 
to select whether the land rental is fixed on a monthly 
basis or is variable (that is, linked to the actual electricity 
consumption at the facility). The latter land rental 
arrangement is often referred to as the revenue sharing 
model. According to the revised consolidated Guidelines & 
Standards for Charging Infrastructure for Electric Vehicles 
(EV) released by the Union Ministry of Power on January 
14, 2022, land available with the government/public entities 
shall be provided for installation of a PCS to a government 
/public entity on a revenue sharing basis at a fixed rate of 
₹1/kWh (used for charging), to be paid to the land-owning 
agency from the PCS business on a quarterly basis. A 
Model Revenue Sharing agreement has also been included 
in the guidelines. Such a revenue sharing agreement may be 
initially entered into by the parties for a period of 10 years. 
The revenue sharing model may also be used by a public 
land-owning agency to provide land to a private entity 
for installation of a PCS on a bidding basis with a floor 
price of ₹1/kWh.
 ▪ To give the user a sense of the possible total land 
requirement to set up a PCS with the given configuration 
and thus arrive at the monthly total fixed land rental, 
FACt autonomously estimates and displays the total 
land requirement on the “User Inputs” page. However, this

 ▪ is not a direct input to the other results of the Tool. This 
FACt autonomously estimates and displays the total land 
requirement on the “User Inputs” page. However, this is not a 
direct input to the other results of the Tool. This value is for 
the user’s reference only; the user has to provide the inputs 
related to land rental on this page. 
OPERATION COST AND SUBSIDIES
 ▪ The user must specify whether the PCS will be staffed for 
the entire daily operational time or not. 
 ▪ The operational hours may differ depending on the operation 
of the host facility. For instance, the operational hours for a 
charging station at a workplace may be 16 hours as against 
24 hours for a stand-alone charging station.
 ▪ The user is also required to input the eligible total capital 
subsidy amount (non refundable) available under central 
and state schemes. The information on the applicable 
capital subsidy will be available in the EV policies or 
scheme documents. 
After keying in the required input values on this page, the 
user should click the Check Pre-set Inputs button to validate 
the default input values. To input a fresh set of values, the 
user should click the Clear All Inputs button at the bottom 
of the worksheet.
Pre-set inputs
Figure 3 shows a sample “Pre-set Inputs” page. Here, the Tool 
is preloaded with default values for a set of parameters that are 
less case specific or more difficult to specify for a user who does 
not have much experience in the sector. However, the values 
may change depending on the implementation context, and 
hence the user is allowed to modify the given values. For specific 
guidance, the user can hover the cursor on each of the different 
input parameter cells on the worksheet or refer to the “Input 
Data Table” page of the Tool or Table A-1 in Appendix A of 
this Technical Note. 
The following categories of data are covered in this 
input worksheet.
CHARGING UNIT CONFIGURATIONS AND COSTS
 ▪ This section feeds default or pre-set values for the power 
ratings and the unit costs of the eight types of charging 
units recognized in the applicable guidelines issued by 
the Ministry of Power, GoI, on January 14, 2022, and are 
commonly deployed at PCSs. For certain types of charging 
units, such as AC Type-2 and CCS-2,  various products or
models are available in the market with different power ratings 
and, consequently, different price tags. The Tool is preloaded 
with default values for charger power ratings and the costs of 
models that are commonly deployed in public charging infra-
structure in India currently. The user can consider a different set 
of values for charger power ratings and costs to accurately reflect 
the applicable PCS configuration. For example, instead of 7 kW, 
one can input 22 kW as the power rating for AC Type-2. The 
value of the cost per charging unit should be revised accordingly. 
Similarly, a PCS may house a stack battery charging system with 
more or less than 12 battery charging units and with different 
power ratings for each unit. The user can modify the required 
input values accordingly.
 ▪ For charging units other than the eight listed on the page, 
the user can provide the required inputs under the charging 
unit category “Other Charger Type.” 
OTHER COSTS FOR CHARGERS/STACK BATTERY 
CHARGING SYSTEM
 ▪ The worksheet includes pre-set values for the cost of 
civil works and installation and commissioning costs as a 
percentage of the total cost of the charging system. These 
costs are used to estimate the cost of charging equipment as 
part of the overall capital investment, as also reflected later 
on the “Cost Dissection” page of the Tool.
ANCILLARY ELECTRICAL INFRASTRUCTURE
 ▪  This section of the Tool feeds pre-set values for the 
power factor of the electricity connection, the cost of the 
distribution transformer (DT) and associated equipment 
per 50 kVA rated capacity, meter costs, and the ancillary 
electrical infrastructure installation cost (including labor). 
 ▪ The power factor is a measure of how effectively the 
incoming power is used in the electrical system. A high 
power factor indicates that the power supplied to the 
electrical system is effectively used. A system with a low 
power factor consumes the incoming electricity supply 
inefficiently, resulting in losses. Information on the power 
factor can be obtained from the serving distribution utility.
 ▪ The cost of the DT and associated equipment per 50 
kVA rated capacity, along with the ancillary electrical 
infrastructure installation cost (including labor), are set 
using the utility-provided values, and the meter costs are set 
using the India Smart Grid Forum’s values. The India Smart 
Grid Forum is a public-private partnership initiative of the 
Ministry of Power, GoI.

 ▪ These costs are used to infer the cost of ancillary equipment 
as part of the overall capital investment, as also reflected later 
on the “Cost Dissection” page of the Tool.
OTHER POSSIBLE INCOMES FOR CPOS
 ▪ Users are required to input the parking charges (if applicable) 
for each of the selected charging unit types. By default, the 
Tool considers parking charges to be zero. These charges are 
typically applicable only to certain use cases employing 
slow/moderately fast chargers such as destination charging 
 
(such as malls) and charging at public-authority-owned 
parking. For shops and rest stops, customers usually park for 
15–30 minutes, making a fast-charging solution ideal; hence, 
parking charges may not typically be applicable here.
 ▪ As a CPO may explore secondary income sources at the 
facility through advertisements, public conveniences, 
refreshment kiosks, and so on, to complement its core 
revenue from the charging business, the “Pre-set Inputs” 
page can capture the secondary net revenue for the CPO. By 
default, the Tool does not consider any non core income.

OPERATIONAL DETAILS
The worksheet includes pre-set values for the daily operational 
hours and annual operational days of the PCS. The default 
values are 24 and 365, respectively.
OTHER TECHNICAL DETAILS
 ▪ The worksheet includes values for the power demand 
threshold for an exclusive DT , charger efficiency, 
time for planned annual maintenance, and auxiliary 
electricity consumption. 
 ▪ The power demand threshold (kVA) for an exclusive DT 
is a critical parameter that can potentially impact the 
up-front investment of the CPO. If the sanctioned load for 
the electricity connection of the PCS equals or exceeds the 
given threshold, the CPO would be required to install an 
exclusive DT for the PCS. The Tool by default considers the 
threshold value applicable to the National Capital Territory 
of Delhi. However, the value varies from state to state and 
can be obtained from the applicable State Electricity Supply 
Code Regulations. One may also check with the concerned 
electricity distribution utility.
 ▪ Charger efficiency can be defined as the percentage of power 
drawn from the energy source that is actually fed to the 
vehicle battery. The default efficiency is 98 percent.
 ▪ The Tool considers 5 percent of operational hours as the time 
set aside for planned annual maintenance of the PCS. EV 
charging units require periodic checks for wear and tear, as 
well as to keep the overall system clean.
 ▪ Auxiliary electricity consumption is related to other electrical 
end uses at the PCS, such as illumination at the site. 
OTHER OPERATIONAL AND MAINTENANCE  
COSTS (ANNUAL)
 ▪ This section of the Tool feeds values for annual maintenance 
costs as a percentage of the cost of the core hardware, 
the insurance cost as a percentage of the total cost of the 
charging system, the electric vehicle supply equipment 
(EVSE) management software cost per unit of dispensed 
electricity, the hourly operator cost if the PCS is staffed, 
and the minimum alternate annual operator cost for a 
crewless facility.
 ▪ The hourly operator cost becomes applicable (and the 
corresponding value is triggered in the “Pre-set Inputs” 
page) if the user chooses “Yes” to answer the question of 
whether the PCS needs to be staffed. In that case, the hourly 
operator cost is fed into the calculation. The hourly rate is the 
minimum wage limit for semi-skilled labor notified by the 
Ministry of Labour & Employment, GoI.
 ▪ An operator may be required for periodic checks and 
troubleshooting at a PCS even if it is crewless. In this case, 
a dedicated operator may not be required. A lump-sum cost 
has been considered for this purpose as a minimum alternate 
annual operator cost.
FINANCING
 ▪ The worksheet includes pre-set values for debt as a 
percentage of the capital investment, the construction period 
(which is notional, for the purpose of accounting), the loan 
repayment period, and the rate of interest on the loan. 
 ▪ The default loan repayment period is taken to be six years 
based on the commonly used lending practice. 
 ▪ Default values based on the State Bank of India’s benchmark 
prime lending rate (BPLR) have been provided for the 
interest rate on loans.
OTHER COSTS INCURRED BY CPO
 ▪ The pre-set values in the Tool account for cost items 
such as service-line-cum-development charges 
(SLDC) and tax rates.
 ▪ SLDC is a one-time charge that a consumer has to pay to 
the serving electricity distribution utility when applying 
for a new electricity connection. The amount is usually 
linked to the sanctioned load (kVA) for the connection. 
SLDC becomes applicable (and the corresponding value is 
triggered on the “Pre-set Inputs” page) if the user states on 
the “User Inputs” worksheet that a new dedicated electricity 
connection is needed. By default, SLDC charges are based 
on the rates prevailing in the National Capital Territory of 
Delhi. Information on the charges for a new connection can 
be obtained from the concerned serving distribution utility.
 ▪ Default values based on the current landscape have been 
provided for the corporate tax and minimum alternate 
tax (MAT) rates.
BENCHMARKING
 ▪ To assess the business attractiveness of an investment in a 
PCS, benchmarking the estimated project IRR against a 
hurdle rate is an industry-wide practice. For this purpose, the 
Tool bases the benchmark rate of return on the State Bank 
of India’s BPLR. 
YEAR-ON-YEAR (Y-O-Y) ESCALATIONS
 ▪ The “Pre-set Inputs” worksheet has default values for the 
Y-o-Y escalations of the cost or operational parameters, 
which tend to vary with time. These include the electricity 
rate, land rental, other operational and maintenance (O&M)

TECHNICAL NOTE   |  March 2023  |  11
Financial Analysis of Charging station (FACt)
  
costs, charging fees, hourly parking charges, secondary 
revenue, and average daily active use of charging units. 
 ▪ The default Y-o-Y escalation rates are based on stakeholder 
consultations or past trends. The user can change these rates 
depending on the market outlook.
After changing the input values on this worksheet, a one-click 
option, Restore Default Inputs, can be used to restore the defaults 
if required. The Check Results button will take the user to the first 
of the four output-related pages.
Output pages
The Tool offers six different outputs: project cost composition, 
calculation of the project IRR, estimation of the contributions 
of the key input parameters to the project’s net cash inflow, 
sensitivities of major input variables, revenue trends for the 
associated actors, and Solver analysis (which helps identify the  
changes in the values of the key input parameters needed to 
achieve the benchmark rate of return). These six sets of outputs 
are captured by the Tool on the following four output pages. The 
Print button on each output worksheet can be used to print the 
entire active worksheet in formats such as PDF.  
The following section gives a short description of the output 
pages. Table A-2 in Appendix A shows the details (such as the 
outputs, the section in which the output is displayed in the Tool, 
the unit of the output, and guidance specific to the output for 
users) of each output.
Cost dissection
This output page produces the following two sets of results
(see Figure 4).
BREAKUP OF THE TOTAL PROJECT COST OVER THE 
PROJECT PERIOD 
The breakup shows the estimates for the major components 
and their sub-components over the 10-year project period. The 
components include the following:
 ▪ Capital investment
 ▪ Cost of charging equipment
 ▪ Cost of ancillary equipment
 ▪ Cost of electricity
 ▪ Energy charges
 ▪ Demand charges
 ▪ Land rental
 ▪ Other O&M costs
 ▪ Operator cost
 ▪ EVSE management software cost
 ▪ Maintenance costs and miscellaneous expenses
 ▪ Interest on term loan
The 10-year costs for the given components are also expressed 
per unit of dispensed electricity,12 which can be considered 
the buildup for the cost of the charging service over the entire 
project period. This can be a useful yardstick for setting the 
charging fee. The project period is considered 10 years, in line 
with the procurement practices for setting up and operating 
a PCS in India.13 In the majority of cases, the concessionaire 
agreements are found to be effective for about 10 years. Hence, 
market players are interested in understanding the financial 
viability of a project for the span of the concessionaire period. 
Policymakers and implementing agencies, therefore, should 
also frame the tender clauses or the concessionaire agreement 
such that an investor would be able to realize modest returns 
during the project period; that is, 10 years. Hence, to support in 
the financial evaluation and make the results meaningful and 
relevant, the Tool too adopts a similar project timespan for the 
associated calculations. All duration-sensitive outputs from the 
Tool are based on a 10-year project period. If required, from the 
results, one can easily deduce the possible outcome for a little 
shorter or longer project timeline.
TOTAL ANNUAL OPERATING COST OF RUNNING A PCS
The analysis of the annual operating cost includes estimates 
for the cost of electricity, land rental, and other O&M costs 
over the 10-year operation of the PCS. The breakup is also 
presented graphically.
Project IRR and sensitivity
Figure 5 shows a sample “Project IRR & Sensitivity” page. The 
underlying core methodology of the Tool is the one widely used 
in the industry for calculating the project IRR, a commonly 
applied indicator for evaluating the profitability of a potential 
investment.  The Tool auto-generates the IRR based on the 
user-provided inputs on the input pages.
Once the IRR for a project is determined, it is typically 
compared with the investor’s hurdle rate or cost of capital. If 
the IRR equals or exceeds the cost of capital, the project is 
considered investment worthy. A hurdle rate, which is also 
known as the benchmark, or minimum acceptable rate of return, 
is the minimum rate of return or target rate that the investor 
expects to realize on an investment. The rate is generally

 ▪ A “positive” IRR indicates that the project or investment is 
expected to offer a positive return to the investor. 
 ▪ A “negative” IRR occurs when the aggregate net cash 
inflow from the project is less than the initial or up-front 
investment, which means the investor will realize a negative 
return on the investment. 
 ▪ A “null” IRR indicates that either the net cash inflow does 
not have at least one negative and one positive value (which 
is a likely reason) or the Excel calculation fails to converge

14  |  
  
 ▪ to a result after 20 iterations (set by default in 
Excel [CFI 2022]).
As part of the impact analysis, the Tool analyzes the dataset to 
gauge the contributions of the key input parameters or variables 
(such as the capital investment, charging fees, parking charges, 
capital subsidy, cost of electricity, land rental, average daily 
active use of charging units, and other O&M costs) to the 
project’s net cash inflow. Based on the data input by the users 
on the input pages, the table and the corresponding graph of 
the contributions of the key input parameters or variables are 
automatically updated in the Tool and reflected in the displayed 
results. The key factors influencing the input parameters are 
listed alongside the input parameters in the table. The Tool also 
predicts possible changes in the project IRR value with ±10 and 
±20 percent variation in the values of the key input parameters 
compared to their original, or base-case, values using the 
sensitivity (what-if ) analysis. The given variation range is 
considered reasonable for studying the uncertainty in the 
project IRR associated with changes in the key input variables. 
For investment in public charging infrastructure, the key input 
variables are the capital investment, charging fees, capital 
subsidy, cost of electricity, land rental, other O&M costs, and the 
average daily active use of the charging units. The Tool is able to 
auto-generate the results without user intervention.
The sensitivity analysis is helpful for the stakeholders of the 
charging infrastructure ecosystem because the values of the 
input parameters constantly evolve depending on market 
developments, consumer preferences, and government 
regulations. This feature of the Tool will enable stakeholders to 
easily forecast the likely fluctuations in the project IRR.

corresponding graph representing the revenue trends for 
the entire project duration are automatically updated in the 
displayed results. 
The Tool projects the gross revenue and net cash inflow for the 
CPO, the revenue for the distribution utility, and the revenue 
for the land-owning entity over the project duration. This is to 
give a sense of the possible revenues for the actors involved in 
the implementation of a PCS. It is considered an important 
insight for implementing agencies, regulators, city authorities, 
and policymakers.
Moreover, the specific years in the project period that are 
envisaged to register a positive net cash inflow for the CPO will 
automatically appear in green, indicating that the breakeven for 
the project has been achieved. This visual representation would 
help users easily identify the break-even year if it is within the 
project duration of 10 years. 
Solver 
Figure 7 shows a sample “Solver” page. Solver shows the 
required changes in the values of the different input variables 
that in combination will help achieve the benchmark project 
IRR or the hurdle rate (if the project IRR in the base case 
falls short of the target). With the click of a button, the Tool 
produces the required results. While carrying out the iterations, 
Solver takes into account the individual contributions of the 
input variables to the project IRR as reflected in the earlier 
section (the “Project IRR & Sensitivity” page) of the Tool. 
Boundary conditions have also been imposed on the Solver 
function to ensure that the results from the permutations and 
combinations of the input variables are realistic. 
In addition, on this page, the user can conduct sensitivity 
analyses by varying the input parameters over any range.

where:
CF0 = The capital investment or outlay in the project; that is, the 
up-front investment expected to be incurred to set up a PCS
The capital investment cost usually covers the capital needed to 
build the charging station:
Capital investment = Cost of Charger/Battery Swapping System 
+ Cost of Ancillary Electrical Infrastructure
(Note: These costs are used to calculate the investment and are 
exclusive of Goods & Services Tax (GST).) 
CF1, CF2, CF3 … CFn = Cash flows; that is, all the possible 
incomes or cash inflows (including the capital subsidy) and 
one-time as well as recurrent expenditures for setting up and 
operating a PCS
n = Each period; that is, one year in this case
N = The project period; that is, the contract period to operate the 
PCS, which is considered 10 years
The given IRR formula can be applied in Excel using 
the IRR function. 
The IRR for a project is typically compared with the investor’s 
hurdle rate or cost of capital, and the project is considered 
investment-worthy if the IRR equals or exceeds the cost of 
capital. The hurdle rate, as explained previously, is the minimum 
required rate of return or target rate that the investor expects 
to realize on an investment. The Tool allows the user the 
flexibility of setting a different hurdle rate for benchmarking 
the project IRR. 
The cash inflows include the following:
 ▪ Income from EV charging fees
 ▪ Charging Fee Revenue = (Number of Charging Units × 
Charger Power Rating × (Average Daily Active Use of 
Charging Unit ÷ Number of Daily Operational Hours × 
100) × (Number of Daily Operational Hours × Number 
of Annual Operational Days) × (1 − Time for Planned 
Annual Maintenance)) × Charging or Swapping Fee Rate
(Note: This formula must be separately applied to each 
of the different charging unit types to arrive at the 
cumulative charging fee revenue)
 ▪ Income from parking charges (if applicable)
 ▪ Income from Parking Charges = (Number of Charging 
Units × (Average Daily Active Use of Charging Unit 
÷ Number of Daily Operational Hours × 100) × (Number 
of Daily Operational Hours × Number of Annual 
Operational Days) × (1 − Time for Planned Annual 
Maintenance)) × Hourly Parking Charges
 ▪ Net income from secondary sources or non core 
businesses such as advertisements (if applicable)
 ▪ Capital subsidy from the government (if applicable)
On the other hand, cash outflows cover the following:
 ▪ Cost of electricity 
Cost of electricity = (Energy Charge per kWh × Annual 
Electricity Consumption) + (Demand Charge per kVA 
Month × Power Demand of the Charging Station  
× Number of Months)
 ▪ Land rental 
The land rental, when fixed on a monthly basis, can be 
calculated as follows: 
Land Rental = Total Monthly Land Rental  
× Number of Months 
When linked to electricity consumption, land rental can 
be calculated as follows:
Land Rental = Annual Electricity Consumption × Rate of 
Land Rental per Unit of Electricity Consumption
 ▪ Other O&M costs 
Other O&M Costs = Annual Maintenance Costs  
+ EVSE Management Software Cost + Insurance Cost 
+ Operator Cost 
Here, annual maintenance costs are calculated as a 
percentage of the cost of chargers and of the DT . The cost
where: 
Cin = Cost due to item i in the nth year of the project
En = Total dispensed electricity in the nth year of the project
N is the total project period; that is, 10 years.

 ▪ of the EVSE management software is pegged at ₹1 
per unit of dispensed electricity. The insurance cost is 
calculated as a percentage of the cost of the chargers. The 
operator cost comprises the costs of staffing the PCS. If 
the facility is crewless, there is a fixed cost for periodic 
checking and troubleshooting.

 ▪ Interest on the term loan and depreciation are also duly 
accounted for in accordance with standard practice.
Gauging the contribution of key 
input parameters
To evaluate the contribution of a key input parameter or variable 
to the net cash inflow, the Tool calculates its cumulative share 
(in the form of a cash inflow or outflow) in the aggregate net 
cash inflow or income for the project over the entire project 
period; that is, as
where: 
CFi = Cash inflow or outflow due to item i
CF = Absolute value of all cash flows
Undertaking sensitivity (what-if) analysis
Based on the given key input variables and the sensitivity range, 
the analysis is carried out using the Data Table function of 
“What-If Analysis” in the Data tab of Excel.
Projecting potential revenue for  
concerned stakeholders
The Tool utilizes the parameters considered in the project IRR 
calculation to forecast the possible incomes of the CPO, the 
power distribution utility, and the land-owning entity over the 
project contract period of 10 years. Accounting for the gross 
and net revenues from the PCS is straightforward for the 
CPO because these are already included in the project IRR 
calculation. To estimate the revenue for the power distribution 
utility from the PCS, the Tool considers the value of the “Cost 
of Electricity,” which is a cash outflow item in the project IRR 
computation. Similarly, the revenue for the land-owning entity 
from the PCS is equal to the “Land Rental,” which is accounted 
as a cash outflow item in the project IRR calculation.
Executing Solver
The Tool employs the Solver function (under the Data tab), an 
Excel add-in, but simplifies the execution by applying Excel 
macros to give users a hassle-free experience.
CAVEATS FOR THE USER
Despite the well-thought-out approach to formulating 
and designing the Tool, rigorous user testing, and prompt 
troubleshooting, the following limitations (or risks) of the Tool 
have been identified. 
Limited quality risk
FACt requires the user to provide a limited number of 
mandatory inputs and validate or change a set of default input 
values. Detailed guidance is available if the user needs it. Also, 
the data validation function of Excel has been applied on the 
input worksheets to flag and prevent inappropriate data inputs. 
The analytical framework employed in the Tool is an industry 
standard. However, there could still be an element of risk if the 
user provides data inputs that do not appropriately reflect the 
context, in spite of the given guidance. This situation is beyond 
the control of the Tool. 
Avoidable usage glitches
On the “User Guide” page of the Tool, specific caveats have been 
given. The user should be aware of the following:
 ▪ Macros should be enabled in the Trust Settings after 
opening the Excel file; otherwise, some functions of the

User Inputs worksheet
Number of  
charging units
- To consider the public charging station 
(PCS) configuration that will impact 
capital expenditures (CAPEX) and 
operating expenses (OPEX)
The user has to enter positive integral 
values for each type of charging unit.
Average daily active 
use of charging unit in 
year 1 of operation
Hours per day - To calculate the income and operational 
cost of the charge point operator (CPO) 
and revenues of the distribution utility 
and land-owning entity
The user has to enter a numerical value 
for each type of charging unit. Note 
that the daily active use of a charging 
unit refers to the daily number of hours 
for which the unit is being used, or is 
expected to be used, for EV charging. 
The number of hours of active use of 
a charging unit is different from (and 
less than) the daily operational hours of 
the charging facility. The active use of 
a charging unit, which depends on the 
demand for EV charging at the facility, 
helps estimate its capacity utilization. 
For example, if a charging unit is in active 
use for 4 hours a day on average out of 
the daily operational hours (16 hours), its 
capacity utilization would be 25%  
(4/16 × 100).
Charging

Project cost breakup Cost Dissection ₹ The breakup of the total project cost over the project period 
shows the estimates for the major components and their 
sub components over the 10-year project period. The 
components include the following:
 ■ Capital investment
• Cost of charging equipment
• Cost of ancillary equipment
 ■ Cost of electricity
• Energy charges
• Demand charges
 ■ Land rental
 ■ Other operational and maintenance (O&M) costs
• Operator cost
• Electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) management 
software cost
• Miscellaneous expenses
 ■ Interest on term loan
Cost per unit of  
electricity dispensed
Cost Dissection ₹/kWh The 10-year costs for the given components are expressed 
per unit of dispensed electricity, which can be considered the 
buildup for the cost of the charging service over the entire 
project period.
Total annual operating cost 
of running a public charging 
station (PCS)
Cost Dissection ₹ Analysis of the annual operating cost shows estimates for the 
cost of electricity, land rental, and other O&M costs over the 
10-year operation of the PCS.
Project internal rate of return 
(IRR) (%)
Project IRR & Sensitivity The project IRR is a commonly employed indicator for  
evaluating the profitability of a potential investment. The 
Tool estimates the possible project IRR for a charge point 
operator (CPO) from the investment in setting up a PCS of 
a certain configuration in a given context. The underlying 
core methodology applied in the Tool for calculating it is the 
one widely used in the industry. Once the IRR for a project is 
determined, it is typically compared with the investor’s hurdle 
rate or cost of capital. If the IRR equals or exceeds the hurdle 
rate, the project is considered investment worthy.

Contribution of the key input 
parameters to the net cash 
inflow (%)
Project IRR & Sensitivity As part of the impact analysis, the Tool analyzes the dataset  
to gauge the contributions of the key input parameters or 
variables (such as capital investment, charging fees, parking 
charges, capital subsidy, cost of electricity, land rental, average 
daily active use of charging units, and other O&M costs) to  
the project’s net cash inflow. Based on the data input by users 
on the input pages, the table and the corresponding graph  
on the contributions of the key input parameters or variables  
are automatically updated in the Tool and reflected in the 
displayed results.
Sensitivity to the key input 
parameters (%)
Project IRR & Sensitivity The Tool predicts possible changes in the project IRR  
value with ±10% and ±20% variations in the values of the  
key input parameters compared to their original or  
base-case values using the sensitivity (what-if) analysis. 
The given range is considered reasonable for studying the 
uncertainty in the project IRR associated with changes in the 
key input variables. As far as investment in public charging 
infrastructure is concerned, the key input variables are the 
capital investment, charging fees, capital subsidy, cost of 
electricity, land rental, other O&M costs, and the average daily 
active use of charging units. The Tool is able to auto-generate 
the results without user intervention.
CPO’s gross revenue Revenue Profile ₹ The Tool analyzes the dataset to project the revenue trends 
(which include the CPO’s gross revenue and net cash inflow, 
the distribution utility’s revenue, and the land-owning entity’s 
revenue) over the entire project duration. This is to give a 
sense of the possible revenues for the actors involved in the 
implementation of a PCS. On the basis of the data input by the 
users on the input pages, the table and the corresponding graph 
representing the revenue trends for the entire project duration 
are automatically updated to show the results.

benchmark rate of return 
/hurdle rate (%)
Solver Solver shows the required changes in the values of the different 
input variables that in combination will help achieve the 
benchmark project IRR or the hurdle rate (if the project IRR in 
the base case falls short of the target). While carrying out the 
iterations, Solver  takes into account the individual contributions 
of the input variables to the project IRR. Certain boundary 
conditions have also been imposed on the Solver  function to 
ensure that the results from the permutations and combinations 
of the input variables are realistic. With the click of a button, 
the Tool produces the required results. In addition, on this page, 
the user can conduct sensitivity analyses by varying the input 
parameters over any range.

ABOUT WRI INDIA
WRI India is a research organization that turns big ideas into
action at the nexus of environment, economic opportunity, and 
human well-being.
Our challenge
Natural resources are at the foundation of economic opportunity and 
human well-being. But today, we are depleting Earth’s resources at 
rates that are not sustainable, endangering economies and people’s 
lives. People depend on clean water, fertile land, healthy forests, 
and a stable climate. Livable cities and clean energy are essential 
for a sustainable planet. We must address these urgent, global 
challenges this decade.
Our vision
We envision an equitable and prosperous planet driven by the wise 
management of natural resources. We aspire to create a world where 
the actions of government, business, and communities combine to 
eliminate poverty and sustain the natural environment for all people.
Our approach
COUNT IT
We start with data. We conduct independent research and draw on 
the latest technology to develop new insights and recommendations. 
Our rigorous analysis identifies risks, unveils opportunities, and 
informs smart strategies. We focus our efforts on influential 
and emerging economies where the future of sustainability 
will be determined.
CHANGE IT
We use our research to influence government policies, business 
strategies, and civil society action. We test projects with communities, 
companies, and government agencies to build a strong evidence 
base. Then, we work with partners to deliver change on the ground 
that alleviates poverty and strengthens society. We hold ourselves 
accountable to ensure our outcomes will be bold and enduring.
SCALE IT
We don’t think small. Once tested, we work with partners to adopt 
and expand our efforts regionally and globally. We engage with 
decision-makers to carry out our ideas and elevate our impact. We 
measure success through government and business actions that 
improve people’s lives and sustain a healthy environment.
