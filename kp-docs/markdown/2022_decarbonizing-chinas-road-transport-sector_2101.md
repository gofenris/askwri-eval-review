summary: "China's road transport emissions can peak before 2030 under stated policies or by 2025 with stronger measures. Full decarbonization—95% reduction from 2020 levels by 2060—requires 100% NEV passenger car sales by 2035, 100% HDT sales by 2050, plus freight mode shifts and improved occupancy. Vehicle electrification offers 48% of cumulative reductions, while structural changes dominate near-term gains through 2035. Required investment totals 39–83 trillion CNY by 2060, with the lowest-cost pathway at 675 CNY per tonne CO₂eq. Air pollutants will decline once China 6 standards are enforced."

Decarbonizing China’s Road Transport Sector: Strategies toward Carbon Neutrality

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
HIGHLIGHTS
 ▪ China’s road transport greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions will continue growing. However, if China 
implements its stated policies, road transport emissions could peak before 2030 and petroleum 
consumption before 2027 . The peaking timeline for GHG emissions could be further advanced to 2025 
and that for petroleum consumption to 2024 if China takes more proactive structural change measures 
(including mode shift and vehicle occupancy improvements). 
 ▪ If China implements all its stated policies, road transport’s GHG emissions in 2060 would decline by 50 
percent from the 2020 level. Further, if radical structural changes and vehicle electrification occur, road 
transport’s GHG emissions in 2060 would reduce by 95 percent from 2020’s level, fulfilling China’s 2060 
carbon neutrality commitment.  
 ▪ Over the long term, vehicle electrification offers the largest decarbonization potential, followed by 
structural changes, fuel efficiency improvements, and the decarbonization of power and hydrogen 
generation sectors. However, structural changes have the largest decarbonization potential in the near 
term (from now until 2035). 
 ▪ Public and private investments of 39–83 trillion Chinese yuan (CNY) cumulatively are needed from 2020 to 
2060 to decarbonize China’s road transport sector. 
 ▪ Air pollutant emissions from China’s road transport sector will decouple from GHG emission trajectories, 
demonstrating a steady declining trend.

Research Problem
Decarbonizing the transport sector globally is 
necessary to meet the Paris Climate Agreement 
goal of limiting warming to below 2 degrees Celsius 
(°C) or the more ambitious 1.5°C target. For China, 
doing so is also critical for meeting the country’s 
goals of peaking carbon dioxide emissions before 
2030 and being carbon neutral by 2060. Further, 
historical and projected trends for growth in 
China’s road transport sector demand have raised 
concerns over national energy security and local 
air pollution. 
At present, transport sectoral emission reduction 
targets and mitigation actions compatible with 
the carbon neutrality target have not yet been 
established. As indicated by the Action Plan for 
Carbon Dioxide Peaking before 2030, released 
by China’s State Council on October 26, 2021, 
petroleum consumption from the road transport 
sector should peak before 2030, with a goal to 
“keep the growth of carbon emissions in the 
transportation domain within an appropriate range” 
(NDRC 2021). This indicates that China’s transport 
emissions probably will not peak before 2030. 
However, existing modelling studies suggest that 
to meet the 2-degree (or 1.5-degree) goal, global 
transport emissions need to peak around 2020–25 
(IEA 2021a; Gota et al. 2018; Fransen et al. 2019). 
Within the transport sector, road transport 
represented the largest share—84.1 percent—of 
transport-related GHG emissions in China in 
2014 (MEE 2020a). To meet its carbon neutrality 
goal, China’s road transport sector needs explicit 
sectoral emission reduction targets, actionable 
strategies, and cost-effective policy instruments. 
This study examines how the sector might be 
decarbonized to inform the following: 
 ▪ The road transport sector’s target setting to help 
achieve China’s carbon peaking and neutrality 
goals  
 ▪ Identification of cost-effective measures that 
deliver on the sectoral emission reduction 
targets, facilitate low-carbon investments, and 
drive technological innovation 
 ▪ Identification of decarbonization measures with 
air pollution reduction co-benefits 
Using the Low Emissions Analysis Platform 
(LEAP) model, we constructed and analyzed the 
results of the following five forecasting scenarios 
(Table ES-1): 
 ▪ The Business as Usual (BAU) scenario is a 
counterfactual scenario, representing no 
improvement in energy efficiency and limited 
degrees of vehicle electrification to help evaluate 
the emissions reduction potential of China’s 
stated policies and the consequences of not 
meeting these targets.    
 ▪ The Stated Policy scenario (“Stated_policy”) is 
based on the stated policies announced by the 
national government and intended actions from 
industrial associations.  
 ▪ The Structural Change scenario (“Low_stock”) 
assumes greater degrees of transport structural 
changes (through two measures—mode shift 
and vehicle occupancy improvements), thereby 
featured by smaller vehicle stocks. 
 ▪ The Deep Electrification scenario (“DeepELE”) 
assumes more rapid diffusion of new energy 
vehiclesi (NEVs), with NEV passenger cars rep-
resenting 100 percent of passenger car sales by 
2035 and NEV medium- and heavy-duty trucks 
(HDTs) representing 100 percent of HDT sales 
by 2050.   
 ▪ The Deep Decarbonization scenario 
(“DeepDecarb”) integrates the Low_stock 
and DeepELE scenarios. Therefore, the 
scenario represents the most ambitious case 
that is compatible with China’s 2060 carbon 
neutrality target.

Research Findings 
Our models indicate the following: First, road 
transport GHG emissions in China would peak 
during 2025–35, and petroleum demand would 
peak during 2024–30 under all scenarios except 
for Business as Usual. Driven by increasing travel 
demand, China’s road transport GHG emissions 
would continue growing. Nonetheless, if China 
implements its stated policies (the Stated_
policy scenario), road transport emissions 
could peak before 2030 and petroleum 
consumption before 2027 (Figure ES-1). The 
peaking timeline for GHG emissions would 
be advanced to 2025 and that for petroleum 
consumption to 2024 at the earliest if China 
takes more proactive structural change 
measures that include mode shifting to 
low-emitting modes as well as increasing 
vehicle occupancy (DeepELE, Low_stock, and 
DeepDecarb scenarios). In the near term, structural 
changes are more effective at peaking emissions 
earlier and reducing emissions to a greater extent 
than vehicle electrification.
Second, over the long term, under different policy 
scenarios, the country can reduce road transport 
GHG emissions in 2060 by about 50–95 percent 
from the base year (2020). Specifically, if China 
implements its stated policies, its road 
transport GHG emissions in 2060 would 
decline by 50 percent from 2020’s level 
(the Stated_policy scenario). Further, if 
a radical shift in vehicle technologies and 
structural changes is made, road transport 
GHG emissions in 2060 would be reduced 
by 95 percent from the 2020 level, realizing 
China’s 2060 carbon neutrality commitment 
(the DeepDecarb scenario) (Figure ES-1). 
To achieve the largest emission reduction 
potential of 95 percent by 2060 in the 
DeepDecarb scenario, four measures—
namely, vehicle electrification, structural 
changes, fuel efficiency improvements, and 
power and hydrogen decarbonization—are 
critical (Figure ES-2 and Table ES-2):
 ▪ Vehicle electrification has the largest de-
carbonization potential, contributing 48 
percent of the cumulative GHG emission 
reduction from the BAU scenario to the Deep-
Decarb scenario during 2020–60. If the decar-
bonization of the power and hydrogen-related sec-
tors follows the roadmaps outlined by the national 
government and industrial associations, vehicle 
electrification could yield a cumulative 60 percent 
emission reduction. 
 ▪ Structural changes have the second-
largest mitigation potential and can cut 
cumulative GHG emissions from 2020 to 
2060 by 23 percent. Of note, in the near 
term (2020–35), structural changes have 
the largest mitigation potential because 
vehicle electrification is not likely to reach the 
tipping point during this time frame. 
Note: Greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide (N20), and methane (CH4). N2O and CH4 use 20-year global warming potential (GWP) values from IPCC (2014).

 ▪ Fuel efficiency improvements can generate 
17 percent of the cumulative emission re-
duction during 2020–60. Further, tightening 
the fleet-wide fuel efficiency standard is instru-
mental to stimulating NEV production, while NEV 
energy efficiency improvements help improve 
NEVs’ driving ranges as well as reduce vehicle 
weights and costs.
Whether natural gas (NG) vehicles should be 
treated as a viable decarbonization solution 
is worth further scrutiny. Although the carbon 
dioxide (CO2) emissions from NG vehicles are 
around 20 percent lower than those of diesel- and 
gasoline-powered vehicles, they have limited GHG 
emissions savings due to methane escape from NG 
vehicles (such as crankcase emissions or dynamic 
venting of the fuel system). This study shows that 
because of large methane leakage, an NG heavy-duty 
truck meeting the China 5 emission standard would 
tend to have higher tank-to-wheel GHG emissions 
than its diesel counterpart. Only when the China 
6 emission standard is stringently enforced would 
a China 6 NG heavy-duty truck reduce tank-to-
wheel GHG emissions by up to 12 percent. In the 
scenario analysis, when the market share of China 
6 NG heavy-duty trucks rises to 50 percent in 2050 
in the Stated_policy scenario (compared with the 
original 15 percent), the wider adoption of NG 
trucks would lead to an additional 7 percent GHG 
emission reduction in 2060 and less than a 3 percent 
cumulative GHG emission reduction from 2020 to 
2060, compared with the Stated_policy scenario. 
Abbreviations: Mt CO2eq = million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent; DeepDecarb = Deep Decarbonization scenario; H 2 = hydrogen; BAU = Business as Usual scenario.
Source: WRI authors’ calculations using the Low Emissions Analysis Platform model. 
This study further reveals that for China to 
achieve its carbon neutrality goal, its stated 
policies need to include increased 
ambition on structural changes and vehicle 
electrification (Table ES-2):
 ▪ For structural changes, a 75–85 percent green 
transport mode share for passenger transport, 
40 percent road freight in the mode split for do-
mestic tonne-kilometers (tkm), and an average 
11.5 tonne load per truck-kilometer
 ▪ For vehicle electrification, NEVs would repre-
sent 100 percent of passenger car sales by 2035 
and 100 percent of HDT sales by 2050 
Reaching China’s carbon neutrality target 
has more pronounced implications for 
freight transport than it does for passenger 
transport. The DeepDecarb scenario shows 
that road freight transport could reduce GHG 
emissions by a cumulative 19,367 million tonnes 
of carbon dioxide equivalent (Mt CO 2eq) from 
2020 to 2060 compared with the BAU scenario, 
over two times the cumulative emission reduction 
associated with road passenger transport 
(9,250 Mt CO 2eq). To unlock road freight’s 
decarbonization potential, China needs to 
make technology advances in long-haul HDTs 
and refrigerated HDTs, promote freight mode 
shifts to railways and waterways, and improve 
freight logistic efficiency. China also needs to 
significantly improve its freight statistical data

collection system to support evidence-based 
policymaking in the above areas. 
The results show that low-carbon investments 
amounting to 39–83 trillion CNY 
cumulatively are needed from 2020 to 2060 
to decarbonize China’s road transport sector. 
The investment demand is the largest from now till 
2035 and will steadily decline over time. Among all 
the scenarios, the Low_stock scenario is the 
lowest-cost pathway, with an average abatement 
cost of 675 CNY per tonne of CO2eq reduced thanks 
to an associated smaller vehicle fleet (Figure ES-3). 
Structural changes are the least-expensive 
measure among all the decarbonization measures 
because a smaller vehicle fleet size reduces needed 
investments in installed capacities for power and

hydrogen generation and transmission as well as 
investments in vehicle acquisition and charging 
(and refueling) infrastructure expansion. 
Vehicle electrification’s abatement costs vary 
significantly over time. Only after the total cost 
of ownership parity for NEV heavy-duty trucks is 
reached (around 2030–35) will NEVs exhibit net 
cost savings compared with internal combustion 
engine (ICE) vehicles. However, the high 
abatement costs of vehicle electrification should 
not deter relevant investments.
After the introduction of the China 6 emission 
standardii (hereafter referred to as the China 6 
standard), road transport’s air pollutant 
emissions would decouple from GHG 
emissions trajectories, showing a steady

declining trend (Figure ES-4). Despite this 
achievement, air pollution abatement 
efforts should be sustained because non-road 
transport sectors such as inland waterways and 
non-road machinery also contribute significant 
amounts of air pollutants, and the next-generation 
China exhaust emission standard (such as a Euro 
7 equivalent standard) would be conducive to 
accelerating NEV adoption. This study further 
shows that for the aforementioned decarbonization 
measures to produce air pollution reduction 
co-benefits, additional measures are necessary, 
including improving railways and waterways’ 
freight operational efficiency, promoting railway 
electrification, tightening the China 6 standard, 
and improving in-use vehicles’ inspection/
maintenance programs (Table ES-3).

Decarbonizing China’s Road Transport Sector: Strategies toward Carbon Neutrality
1
BACKGROUND
Decarbonizing the transport sector globally is necessary to meet the 
Paris Climate Agreement goal of limiting warming to below 2 degrees 
Celsius (°C) or the more ambitious 1.5°C target. For China, doing so is 
also critical for meeting the country’s goals of peaking carbon dioxide 
emissions before 2030 and being carbon neutral by 2060.

In China, transport sector greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions equated to 828 million tonnes of carbon 
dioxide equivalent (Mt CO2eq) in 2014, representing 
6.7 percent of the country’s GHG emissions, 
excluding land use, land-use change, and forestry 
(LULUCF) emissions (MEE 2018a). However, if the 
sectoral emissions continue their upward growth 
trend, this share will enlarge. In fact, even in the 
developed world, such as the 27 members of the 
European Union (EU 27) plus the United Kingdom 
(UK) and the United States, transport-related GHG 
emissions have been increasing since 1990, in 
contrast to the general decreasing emissions trends 
in the power and industrial sectors. In 2019, the 
transport sector accounted for 28.6 percent and 23.6 
percent of total GHG emissions (excluding LULUCF 
emissions) in the United States and EU, respectively, 
rising to become the largest emitter in the United 
States and second-largest emitter in the EU (EEA 
2020; EPA 2020) (Figure 1).

China’s transport GHG emissions contribute 
significantly to global transport GHG emissions.  
They accounted for 11.1 percent of the world’s 
transport GHG emissions in 2018 (Climate 
Watch 2020), following only the United States 
(21.3 percent) and EU 27 plus UK (11.2 percent). 
In the future, China’s transport sector’s global 
contribution could be even greater: It is projected 
that China will have the most road freight activities 
in the world by 2050 (Mulholland et al. 2018) and 
that China and India combined will experience 
the most rapid growth in car ownership, six times 
greater than in 2015, standing in contrast to 16 
percent growth in Organisation for Economic 
Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries 
(ITF 2019). Historical and projected growth trends 
for travel demand in China’s road transport sector 
have raised concerns over national energy security, 
local air pollution, and GHG emissions (Yin et al. 
2015; Hao et al. 2015).
Within the transport sector, mitigating road 
transport emissions is critical to achieving 
China’s 2060 carbon neutrality target. In 2014, 
GHG emissions from road transport represented 
84.1 percent of China’s transport-related GHG 
emissions. Further, unlike aviation and maritime 
shipping where decarbonization efforts are hindered 
by immature technologies and high abatement 
costs, major technology breakthroughs such as 
electric powertrains and hydrogen fuel cells already 
exist for road transport (BloombergNEF 2021).  
In China, sectoral emission reduction targets 
and decarbonization strategies compatible with 
the carbon neutrality target have not yet been 
established. As indicated by the Action Plan for 
Carbon Dioxide Peaking before 2030, released 
by China’s State Council on October 26, 2021, 
petroleum consumption from the road transport 
sector should peak before 2030, with a goal to 
“keep the growth of carbon emissions in the 
transportation domain within an appropriate 
range” (NDRC 2021). This indicates that Chinese 
transport emissions probably will not peak 
before 2030. However, existing modelling studies 
suggest that to meet the 2°C (or more ambitious 
1.5°C) target, global transport emissions need 
to peak around 2020–25 (IEA 2021a; Gota et al. 
2018; Fransen et al. 2019). To that end, China’s 
road transport sector needs explicit sectoral 
emission-reduction targets, actionable strategies, 
and cost-effective policy instruments. Therefore, 
this study aims to inform the following: 
 ▪ The road transport sector’s target setting to help 
achieve China’s carbon peaking and neutrality 
targets 
 ▪ Identification of cost-effective measures that de-
liver on the sectoral target, facilitate low-carbon 
investments, and drive technology innovation
 ▪ Identification of decarbonization measures with 
air pollution reduction co-benefits (see Box 1).

Box  1  |   Transport-Related Air Pollutant Emissions in China
The transport sector is a major contributor to air pollution in 
China, accounting for about 20–50 percent of emissions of 
particulate matter 2.5 micrometers or less in diameter (PM2.5) 
in Chinese cities; in some cities such as Shenzhen, Beijing, and 
Guangzhou, the transport sector is the largest source of PM2.5 
emissions, representing 52 percent, 45 percent, and 22 percent 
of local PM2.5 emissions in those cities, respectively.a 
Although unlike GHG emissions, road transport does not 
dominate air pollutant emissions, it emits more hydrocarbons 
(HC) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) than the non-road transport 
sectors do.

Box  1  |   Transport-Related Air Pollutant Emissions in China (Cont.) 
Since China rolled out its Three-Year Action Plan to Win the 
Blue-Sky Defence Battle in 2018, road transport–related air 
pollutants have been dropping (see Figure B1.2).b For annual 
concentrations of air pollutants to meet the National Ambient 
Air Quality Standard, the country has taken decisive actions, 
including introducing a China 6 emission standard, promoting 
the adoption of new energy vehicles, improving fuel quality, and 
facilitating the freight mode shift from roadways to railways and 
waterways. However, these measures have not corresponded 
to a commensurate impact on decarbonization—although road 
transport–related air pollutant emissions have begun to decline, 
GHG emissions are still growing (Figure B1.2). 
As China increases its public investments to curb environmental 
degradation and improve air quality (from 880.6 billion CNY in 
2015 to 1,063.9 billion CNY in 2020), the cost effectiveness of 
the investments could be improved.c At present, the Ministry of 
Ecology and Environment is responsible for reducing pollution, 
while the National Development and Reform Commission 
is tasked with reducing carbon dioxide emissions. The 
counterbalancing effects between decarbonization measures 
and pollution reduction measures can be overcome through 
interdepartmental coordination and coordinated policymaking.

2.1 Scope of the Analysis
In this study, the road transport sector includes 
passenger carriers, goods carriers, and motorcycles. 
Non-road transport sectors such as aviation, shipping, 
pipelines, and off-road machinery are not covered. 
Table 1 provides an overview of China-specific vehicle 
classification. Given different activity levels and 
driving cycles, buses and taxies are separated from 
“large coaches” and “cars” as independent classes. 
The distribution of various vehicle types in 2020 is 
shown in Figure 2.

Note:  According to the China Bicycle Association, China has 0.3 billion motorcycles (including e-scooters) (Xinhua News 2020)—a larger fleet size than passenger cars. However, because 
many motorcycles are unregistered, research relying on official statistics, which count only 68 million, would underrepresent motorcycles.  
Sources: NBS 2021.
Figure  2  |   Distribution of Vehicle Types in China in 2020
The scope of GHG emissions in this study includes 
well-to-wheel (WTW) emissions—including 
well-to-tank (WTT) emissions, especially from 
electricity/hydrogen generation—and tank-to-
wheel (TTW) emissions from vehicle operations. 
Although this approach differs from the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s 
(IPCC’s) guidelines on national GHG inventories 
(IPCC 2006) where transport’s WTT emissions are 
counted toward the power and industrial sectors 
(and NEVsiii count as zero emissions), our approach 
enables us to evaluate whether the large-scale 
adoption of NEVs could actually cut emissions. 
Further, the emissions from the production and 
maintenance of vehicles and construction and 
maintenance of infrastructure are not included. 
The GHG emissions covered in this study include 
CO2, methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). 
 ▪ CO2 is primarily released through fuel combus-
tion and upstream electricity/hydrogen gen-
eration. Since it represents the largest share of 
transport-related GHG emissions, it falls within 
the scope of this study. 
 ▪ CH4 is emitted via fuel combustion from motor 
vehicles and methane leaked from natural gas 
(NG) vehicles (Mottschall et al. 2020). Recent 
research shows that for lean burn NG vehicles—
a type of engine common in China that relies 
on a high air-to-fuel ratio—methane leakage is 
considerable: The CH4 emission factor for China 
5 NG vehicles is eight times higher than the 
IPCC’s default value (Pan et al. 2020). As NG 
vehicles are widely used in China, we included 
CH4 emissions in this study.    
 ▪ N2O is emitted via fuel combustion and after-re-
treatment of exhaust gases. In particular, higher 
emissions of N2O are found in diesel vehicles 
in compliance with higher emission standards 
such as China 5 and China 6. This is because 
the use of advanced aftertreatment systems to 
reduce NOx emissions leads to increased N2O 
emissions (Clairotte et al. 2020). With the roll-
out of the China 6 emission standard, N2O emis-
sions are likely to increase and so are included 
in this study.  
 ▪ Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) such as HFC-134a 
(1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane) result from leaks and 
the end-of-life disposal of air conditioners used 
in vehicles (EPA 2015). Although HFC-134a 
has a low ozone-depleting potential, its global 
warming potential (GWP) is large. But due to

limited data availability, we did not include 
HFC emissions in this study.
Air pollutants in this study include only TTW 
emissions since the major health impact from 
transport air pollutants is on the tailpipe side 
(TTW). In this study, TTW emissions include 
exhaust emissions and evaporative emissions; tire 
and brake wear emissions are not covered due to a 
lack of localized emission factors (Table 2).  
The air pollutants considered in this study are the 
pollutants regulated in the China 1–6 vehicle emissions 
standards including carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen 
oxides (NOx), non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC), 
CH4, N2O, fine particulate matter (PM2.5), and coarse 
particulate matter (PM10, particulate matter 10 
micrometers or less in diameter). Notably, there are 
overlaps between air pollutants and GHG emissions. 
For example, PM10 also includes black carbon, a type 
of short-lived climate pollutant with significant GWP, 
while GHG emissions like CH4 and N2O are also air 
pollutants. For simplicity, the GHG emissions in this 
study include only CO2, CH4, and N2O (hence, CH4 and 
N2O are not treated as air pollutants).    
2.2 Modelling Methodology
2.2.1 Emissions accounting and forecasting
We modelled current and future GHG and air 
pollutant emissions mostly using the Low Emissions 
Analysis Platform (LEAP) (Heaps 2022). As an 
integrated assessment model, LEAP can capture the 
interactions between supply sectors (e.g., power) 
and demand sectors (e.g., transport), such as the 
impact of energy demand on energy prices (Yeh 
et al. 2017). For simplicity, this study focuses on 
the transport sector alone, without endogenous 
interactions with supply sectors.
To estimate base-year GHG emissions, we 
used the bottom-up method in LEAP (Equation 1). 
To estimate air pollutants, we used MEE (2014b) to 
Notes:  a. Emissions were calculated but not analyzed in-depth for decarbonization measures. 
b.  Carbon dioxide emissions from urea consumption in the selective catalytic reduction system—a type of pollutant aftertreatment device to reduce nitrogen oxides—are not 
considered due to limited emissions.
c. Evaporative emissions include hot soak, diurnal, and running loss emissions; refueling emissions are not accounted for.

calculate both exhaust emissions (Equation 2) and 
evaporative emissions (Equation 3).  
 ▪ For CO2 emissions: 
       E=∑i Pi×FEi×VKTi×EFi   (Equation 1)
where, 
E represents CO2 emissions (kilograms; kg)
Pi  is the vehicle stock of vehicle segment i (number 
of vehicles)
FEi  is the fleet-average fuel efficiency of vehicle 
segment i (in liters per 100 kilometers [L/100 
km] for diesel and gasoline, megajoules per 
100 kilometers [MJ/100 km] for natural gas, 
kilowatt-hours per 100 kilometers [kWh/100 
km] for electricity, and kilograms per 100 
kilometers [kg/100 km] for hydrogen) 
VKTi  is the average annual vehicle kilometers 
travelled of vehicle segment i (km) 
EFi  is the CO2 emission factor of different energies 
(kg/L, kg/MJ, kg/kWh). For electricity and 
hydrogen, EFi is the upstream WTT emission 
factors for power and hydrogen generation and 
distribution. For electricity distribution, an 8 
percent transmission and distribution loss and 
charging efficiency loss is assumed.
 ▪ For exhaust air pollutants, CH4, and N2O:
       E=∑i Pi×EFi×VKTi (Equation 2)
where, 
E  represents exhaust air pollutant, CH4, or N2O 
emissions (kg)
EFi  represents the emission factors for air 
pollutants, CH4, and N2O for vehicle segment i 
(kg/km) 
 ▪ For evaporative air pollutants:
       E=(EFrunning×  VKT  +EFsoak+diurnal×365)×Pi         
 (Equation 3)
where, 
E is evaporative pollutant emissions (kg)
EFrunning  is the emission factor for running losses 
(kg/hour) 
EFsoak+diurnal  is the emission factor for hot soak and 
diurnal emissions (kg/day) 
V is the average vehicle speed (km/hour) 
To forecast future emissions, we employed 
the vehicle fleet turnover model in LEAP. For each 
year, we projected the total number of vehicle 
stocks. Then we calculated annual vehicle sales 
based on vehicles’ survival rates and the annual 
growth (or decrease) in vehicle stocks. We applied 
the market shares of different vehicle technologies 
to the new sales to obtain the fleet composition by 
vehicle technology. We used the latter for emission 
forecasting following Equations 1, 2, and 3.   
As a technology-rich model, LEAP is capable 
of modelling the decarbonization potentials of 
low-carbon technology deployment. However, it 
does not model the effects of structural changes 
(including mode shift and vehicle occupancy 
improvements) well. To make up for this weakness, 
we developed a Microsoft Excel–based model to 
forecast future travel demand and vehicle stocks 
affected by structural changes. Because of varying 
degrees of data availability, we used a tonne-
kilometer (tkm) method for freight transport and a 
vehicle-centric method for passenger transport (see 
Figures 3 and 4 and Appendix A).
Using the tkm method, we projected future freight 
vehicle stocks based on the growth in domestic 
freight tkm, mode share of road freight, and truck 
load improvements. Therefore, the effects of 
structural changes were explicitly modelled for 
freight transport. However, applying the same 
method to passenger transport was challenging 
because data on the total passenger kilometers 
travelled (pkm) and vehicle occupancy rates were 
not available—China’s official statistical system 
does not cover the travel activities of private cars. 
Therefore, we used the vehicle-centric method 
for passenger transport, where passenger vehicle 
stocks were projected based on historical trends and 
qualitative evaluations of the impacts of structural 
changes based on a literature review. 
We localized the model inputs based on official 
statistical data, model estimates, a literature review, 
and expert consultations. See Table 3 for a qualitative 
assessment of the quality of the data inputs. As the 
emission estimates from bottom-up approaches 
are affected by the limited data quality of vehicle 
kilometers travelled (VKTs), we validated the bottom-
up emission estimate in the base year with the top-
down estimate using national energy balances.

2.2.2 Abatement cost calculation
We estimated the marginal abatement cost—the 
abatement cost per unit of emissions reduced in a 
given year (Equation 4)— for different mitigation 
policies and technologies to evaluate their cost-
effectiveness. 
Marginal abatement cost
=     Abatement cost
      Emissions abated      (Equation 4)
As depicted in Equation 5, abatement costs 
are the net present values of the costs (such as 
expenses related to infrastructure investments) 
and savings (such as fuel cost savings) associated 
with the mitigation measures. These costs or 
savings could be assessed from the perspective of 
the end users or that of the society. When taking 
the societal perspective, taxes and subsidies are 
excluded as they are transfers between entities 
within a society, while taxes and subsidies are 
included when calculating from the end-user 
perspective (Schroten et al. 2012). This study took 
a societal perspective and excluded tax rebates 
and subsidies from the analysis. Therefore, the 
following costs are societal costs, including both 
public and private investments.
Abatement cost
=   Total cost-total savings
        (1+discount rate)year t       (Equation 5)
The estimation of abatement costs is distinguished 
by the mitigation measures:   
 ▪ The abatement cost of alternative vehicle tech-
nologies: Taking electric vehicles (EVs) as an 
example, the abatement cost is the difference 
between the total cost of EV ownership and the 
total cost of internal combustion engine (ICE) 
vehicle ownership (Equation 6). The total cost 
of EV ownership in a given year is the EV’s life-
time total cost of ownership (TCO) iv multiplied 
by the annual sale volume of EVs. The lifetime 
TCO of EVs consists of upfront vehicle pur-
chase costs, energy costs, and levelized costs 
of charging/refueling throughout the vehicle’s 
useful life. The levelized costs of charging/
refueling denote the total capital expenses 
(CAPEX) and operating expenses (OPEX) of 
charging/refueling infrastructure v amortized 
to the EV’s total energy demand. As explained 
earlier, we excluded taxes and subsidies from 
the study.
Abatement cost
=  (EVcapital,t+EVoperation,t)×Salest-ICEcostt× Salest
                                    (1+r)year t 
 (Equation 6)
where,
EVcapital,t  is the EV’s purchase cost without taxes 
and subsidies in year t 
EVoperationt  includes lifetime electricity or hydrogen 
costs of the EV purchased in year t 
ICEcostt  is the lifetime TCO of a new ICE vehicle 
in year t 
Salest  is the sales volume of EVs in year t 
r  is the annual social discount rate (3 percent in 
this study)

 ▪ The abatement cost of structural changes includes CAPEX and OPEX investments in transit, ac-
tive mobility, and railway infrastructure as well as the cost savings from owning a smaller vehicle 
fleet under the effect of structural changes. Specifically, in a given year, structural change measures 
quantified by infrastructure investments lead to fewer vehicle sales (Sales t) than the vehicle sales 
in the baseline scenario (Sales t,no_shift ) without the effect of structural change measures (that is, no 
infrastructure investment). The difference in the total cost of vehicle ownership resulting from dif-
ferent sales volumes is attributed to the deployment of structural change measures. In this study, 
we did the calculation for passenger transport (Equation 7-1) and freight transport (Equation 7-2).   
where,
Costinfrastructure,t is the investment in transit and active mobility infrastructure in year t

SCENARIO 
DESIGN
Future emissions from the road transport sector are affected 
by factors such as service demand growth, structural changes, 
technology deployment, and upstream power and hydrogen 
sector decarbonization. The scenarios modelled in this study are 
based on existing policies and a literature review.
CHAPTER 3

WRI.org.cn
3.1 Influencing Factors 
In general, future emissions from the road transport 
sector are affected by factors such as service 
demand growth, structural changes, technology 
deployment, and upstream power (and hydrogen) 
sector decarbonization (see Table 5). However, 
not all decarbonization measures are applicable to 
China (such as low-carbon fuels) or can be modelled 
by this study (such as carbon pricing). This section 
explains how we considered different measures. 
Further, because uncertainties remain large 
with autonomous driving, we did not cover that 
technology in this study. 
3.2 Decarbonization Measures
The scenarios modelled in this study are based on 
existing policies and a literature review.
3.2.1 Service demand 
In contrast to the modest expected increases in 
travel demand in OECD countries over the next 
30 years (Teske et al. 2021), China is expected to 
have strong growth in service demand during this 
period. In fact, the country experienced drastic 
growth in passenger and freight demand from 
2005 to 2020 (Figure 5):

 ▪ The number of passenger cars in China 
increased 12 times from 19 to 239 million 
(compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 18 
percent) (NBS 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 
2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 
2018, 2019, 2020).
 ▪ Significant increases also occurred for China’s 
domestic freight demand. The tonne-kilometers 
(tkm) (including domestic road, railway, 
waterway, aviation, and pipeline, but excluding 
international maritime shipping and aviation) 
were 15.2 trillion tkm in 2018, increasing more 
than three times (CAGR = 10.5 percent). 
Future growth in passenger cars 
Despite tremendous growth, the passenger car 
ownership rate in China—170 cars per 1,000 persons 
in 2020—is relatively low compared with Japan’s 
493, the EU’s 540, and the United States’ 592 (NBS 
2020; MLITT 2021; Eurostat 2021a; BTS 2021a). 
To project China’s passenger car ownership up to 
2060, we employed the Gompertz model, where the 
growth in car stocks follows an S-shaped curve—the 
growth in car ownership is rapid as gross domestic 
product (GDP) per capita increases but slows 
when approaching the saturation level. Our GDP 
and population forecasts are based on the Shared 
Socioeconomic Pathways (Riahi et al. 2012; see 
Appendix A). We cross-validated the result with 
existing studies. 
The forecasts show that China’s motorization 
will continue until a maximum saturation level is 
reached, though the saturation level for China’s 
passenger cars will be lower than those in developed 
countries (Figures 6 and 7):
 ▪ Existing studies show that if no additional 
policy interventions are pursued, China’s 
passenger car saturation will be likely around 
350–450 passenger cars per 1,000 persons 
by 2050 (Gilbert 2017; ANL 2018; Huo et al. 
2012a), amounting to 450–600 million car 
stocks. In the Stated Policy scenario of this 
study, the saturation level of passenger cars is 
set to 425 cars per 1,000 persons, with total 
passenger car ownership peaking in 2045 at 506 
million vehicles. 
 ▪ Existing studies also reveal that if mode shift 
measures and compact urban planning are 
undertaken, the saturation level can be lowered 
to 260–350 passenger cars per 1,000 persons 
by 2050, amounting to 330–450 million car 
stocks (Gilbert 2017; ANL 2018; Huo et al. 
2012a). In the Structural Change scenario of 
this study, the saturation level is lowered to 
300 cars per 1,000 persons, with car ownership 
peaking in 2040 at 381 million vehicles.

Future growth in freight demand (in tkm)  
Driven by economic growth, China’s freight demand 
should continue growing; however, the growth rate is 
confounded by many uncertainties, including supply 
chain relocation, an economic structural shift to the 
less transport-intensive service sector (H. Wang et al. 
2021),vi and long-term oil price changes. Therefore, 
views are divided on whether China’s freight demand 
growth will be maintained (Figure 8). 
 ▪ Some modelling studies (Fu et al. 2019; ICCSD 
2020) have concluded that with the economic 
shift to less transport-intensive sectors and the 
expected decline in bulk commodity shipments 
(such as of coal and mineral ore), China’s freight 
demand growth will slow starting in 2030 (CAGR 
= 0.6 percent) and plateau during 2040–45 at 
around 18.6–19.8 trillion tkm. Peak demand 
would be only 1.7–1.8 times the demand in 2020.
 ▪ Other research indicates that freight demand is 
affected by both transported tonnes and travel 
distances. Though transported tonnes—like 
bulk commodities—could drop, the distances 
travelled will likely grow given more frequent 
shipments and increases in shipment lengths, 
as in the case of Germany (Frey et al. 2014).

Therefore, to be comparable with the growth 
trends in developed countries, vii China’s 
domestic freight demand in 2050 would be two 
to three times (25.2–32.5 trillion tkm) the level 
in 2020 (Yin et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2017).
This study takes an optimistic view on China’s 
future freight demand given the promising demand 
forecasts in other regions. For example, according to 
Freight Analysis Framework, U.S. domestic freight 
demand will grow to 7.6 trillion ton-miles in 2045, 
only 1.5 times the tkm in 2015 (BTS and FHWA 
2016). Germany’s freight demand is projected to 
reach 896 billion tkm in 2050, 1.4 times the tkm in 
2016 (Agora Energiewende 2020a). Using GDP per 
capita and fuel price elasticities—measurements of 
how freight demand responds to the growth of GDP 
per capita and fuel price increases (see Appendix A; 
Edelenbosch et al. 2017)—we project that China’s 
domestic freight demand will reach 25.9 trillion tkm 
in 2060, 2.5 times the 2020 level. 
3.2.2 Structural changes
Because of high occupancy rates and low emission 
intensity per tkm or pkm, passenger and freight mode 
shifts are essential to reducing carbon footprints and 
alleviating traffic congestion (see Figure 9). 
However, shifts to high-emitting modes are 
occurring in China (Figure 10): 
 ▪ Passenger transport: Due to rapid urban 
expansion, large cities have witnessed increases

in motorized trips (private car and transit), 
leading to reduced non-motorized trips (such 
as biking and e-scootering). For example, the 
mode share by bike, e-scooter, and motorcycle 
in Beijing dropped from 90 percent in 1999 to 
18 percent in 2017 (Fu et al. 2019), while the 
mode share of private cars (including ride-
hailing) increased from 1 percent in 1999 to 36 
percent in 2017. 
The situation is mixed for intercity travel. From 
2001 to 2020, the share of intercity pkm by car 
decreased from 55 to 24 percent, while the share 
of railways grew slightly from 36 to 43 percent. 
However, of note is that an increasing number of 
intercity travel is being undertaken by air, with 
aviation’s mode share rising four times from 8 to 
33 percent.     
 ▪ Freight transport: Due to underpriced 
roadway freight, viii limited track access, and 
undesirable railway service quality from 1990 
to 2020 (Agenbroad et al. 2016), the share 
of railways in domestic tonne-kilometers in 
China shrank drastically over that period 
from 59 to 27 percent (although the rail 
tkm increased almost threefold), while the 
share of road freight increased from 19 to 
54 percent due to strong economic growth 
(Figure 11). During the same period, domestic 
waterways experienced a slight drop from 19 
to 14 percent. 
Compared with North America, Europe, and 
India, China is more reliant on roadways and 
waterways for freight shipments, with roadway 
and waterway tkm increasing by seventeen-fold 
and thirteen-fold, respectively, from 1990 to 
2019. Nonetheless, compared with the United 
States’ recent increase in domestic railway 
activities—resulting from the transition from 
railway-based coal shipments to intermodal 
freight, China’s rail activities have not grown 
since 2010 (Kaak et al. 2018).

Passenger transport mode shift
Unlike countries like the United States where 
interventions like mode shift and increasing vehicle 
occupancy are less effective due to the lock-in 
effect resulting from an already-high dependency 
on private cars (Teske et al. 2021), high-density 
Chinese cities are likely to reverse the ongoing 
passenger mode shift to private cars. This is 
particularly the case considering many small cities 
in China still have a private car mode share of 
around 10–15 percent (ZTB 2017).
This study assumes that in the Stated Policy 
scenario—which is based on NDRC (2021)—that by 
2030, major Chinese cities will have over 70 percent 
green transport mode share in which public transit 
accounts for 45 percent of the total mode share 
(ICCSD 2020). In the Structural Change scenario, 
to keep car ownership (and usage) at a reasonably 
low level, the green transport mode share should be 
elevated to about 75–85 percent, and public transit 
should represent over 50 percent of the total mode 
share (ICCSD 2020). These targets are achievable: By 
prioritizing cycling and walking and strengthening 
modal integration, Shenzhen’s and Beijing city 
center’s green transport mode shares reached 77 
percent and 73 percent, respectively, in 2020 (China 
Transport News 2021; Xinhua News 2021). 
To achieve the elevated targets in the Structural 
Change scenario, the country should embrace 
a paradigm shift from provider-oriented green 
transport services to user-oriented services (Figure 
12; Enoch 2018). Although shared rides (such as 
ride-hailing and carsharing) are integral to this 
paradigm shift, additional measures should be 
taken to avoid their competition with public transit 
and increased “deadhead” miles (Kong et al. 2020; 
Schaller 2021; Zhang et al. 2020). These measures, 
including Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS), should 
enable ride-sharing to supplement transit services 
in places of limited transit accessibility and allow for 
better journey matches to reduce deadhead miles 
(ERTICO 2019). 
Freight transport mode shift 
Although the movement up the value chain and new 
logistics requirements (increasing shipments of 
smaller parcels and just-in-time delivery) inherently 
favors roadways, China has an untapped potential 
to increase rail freight’s mode share. Research 
shows countries with large land coverage and good 
railway networks such as Russia, Australia, and

Canada tend to have higher rail shares than the 
world’s average of road and rail mode split—61:39 
(Kaak et al. 2018), with China as an exception. This 
is mainly due to uncompetitive railway pricing,ix 
underdeveloped intermodal services, and limited 
rail service quality in China (Agenbroad et al. 
2016). For example, for shipment distances over 
400 kilometers, bulk unit trains were about 2–20 
CNY per tonne more expensive than roadways 
in 2018 (H.H. Liu 2018). Further, intermodal 
(containerized) rail services are underdeveloped in 
China: Only 5.4 percent of the rail shipments (by 
weight) were intermodal containers in 2016 (Fu et 
al. 2019), compared with 19 percent in European 
countries (Eurostat 2021b). 
Because China lacks a national freight mode shift 
target and a statistical system to evaluate future 
mode shift potential, this study relies on existing 
research to project freight mode share. However, 
we recommend making substantial improvements 
to the country’s freight statistical system to 
incorporate surveys on commodity flows (by mode, 
distance, and origin/destination pairs), which would 
allow for mode shift target setting and policymaking 
based on commodity-specific evaluations. 
For simplicity, this study assumes under the 
Stated Policy scenario that a larger shift to road 
transport could be prevented (Table 6), whereby 
road transport would represent 50 percent of the 
domestic tkm in 2060 (about 2020’s level). This 
is consistent with the median value of the existing 
predictions (J.L. Liu et al. 2021; ICCSD 2020; Pan 
et al. 2018; Wang et al. 2017; Zhang et al. 2016; 
Yin et al. 2015; Hao et al. 2015; Huo et al. 2012a) 
(Figure 13). 
Under the Structural Change scenario, this study 
assumes that an explicit mode shift target—40 
percent road transport in domestic tkm in 2060—will 
be established (Figure 13). To achieve this target,

systematic measures will need to be undertaken: 
 ▪ For the rail sector: In the near term, the country 
could shift more bulk commodities to railways 
and waterways, considering roadways still 
dominate shipments of steel, cement, and gravel 
(Fu et al. 2019). Over the long term, as the country 
moves up the value chain, and the volumes of 
bulk commodity shipments drop, transitioning 
to intermodal freight for high-value products 
will be necessary. This transition would mean 
new geographical patterns of rail activities, 
new investment needs, and higher service 
requirements (SFC n.d.; Kaak et al. 2018) for 
railway companies. The railroad industry, which 
has been monopolized by state-owned enterprises, 
will need to enhance service connectivity among 
rail segments, rationalize pricing, improve 
scheduling and on-time performance, automate 
freight (un)loading, avoid loss/breakage, and 
reinforce first-/last-mile truck delivery. 
 ▪ For the road sector: Interventions are needed 
to tackle China-specific challenges including 
truck capacity oversupply, underpriced road 
shipments, and thin profit margins that are 
crucial to improving the cost-competitiveness 
of rail services (for concrete interventions, see 
Vehicle occupancy rate improvements). 
Vehicle occupancy rate improvements 
Improving vehicle occupancy rates is critical to 
reducing vehicular emissions because the same 
demand can be fulfilled with fewer vehicles. 
For passenger transport, although ride sharing is 
an important measure to increase the occupancy 
rate for private cars, priority should be given to 
increasing occupancy rates for public transit. 
This is particularly the case when many Chinese 
cities have witnessed declining bus ridership and 
low bus occupancy: For example, the average 
occupancy rate of buses was 22 percent in Shenzhen 
in recent years (in terms of the carrying capacity 
for a mainstreamed 10-meter bus), smaller than 
Hong Kong’s roughly 30–85 percent (in terms 
of the carrying capacity for a mainstreamed 
three-axle double-decker) (Lai n.d.). To increase 
ridership, rationalization of traditional bus services, 
introduction of demand-responsive services, 
and comprehensive travel demand management 
measures are necessary.     
For road freight transport, operational 
efficiency needs to be significantly improved. 
With tightened controls over truck overloading 
(MOT 2017a), x the average load of road freight 
(quantified by dividing annual tonne-kilometers

by total vehicle-kilometers) had declined to 
9.8 tonnes in 2020, lower than the EU’s 11.5 
tonnes (Eurostat 2021c). Further, 40 percent of 
China’s vehicle-kilometers were empty running, 
compared with the EU’s and United States’ 20 
percent (Yang et al. 2019; ATRI 2020). 
Due to operational inefficiency, the size of the 
heavy-duty truck fleet is excessively large in 
China: Though China’s road freight tkm were 
two to three times higher than those in the EU 
27 and the United States in 2020, the number 
of heavy-duty trucks in China was three to five 
times higher than those in the EU 27 and the 
United States in the same year (Table 7). If the 
issues with truck underutilization and oversupply 
persist, they will intensify the unhealthy 
competition (such as underbidding of roadway 
prices) within the trucking industry and deter 
freight mode shift to low-carbon modes.  
Underutilized trucks, inefficient operations, and 
a dependency on road freight will further boost 
future truck fleet sizes. By this study’s estimates, 
in the Stated Policy scenario where trucks 
remain inefficiently operated (with an average 
load of 9.5 tonnes) and roadways consist of 50 
percent freight tkm, China’s future fleet size of 
medium- and heavy-duty trucks (GVWs above 
4.5 tonnes) will double from 9.5 million in 2020 
to 20 million in 2060. However, in the Structural 
Change scenario, with operational efficiency 
improvements (average load = 11.5 tonnes) and 
freight mode shift, the future fleet size of HDTs 
will be maintained at 12 million in 2060, only 
a modest 26 percent increase from the 2020 
level and half the fleet size in the Stated Policy 
scenario (Table 14). 
Although there is an upper limit to logistic 
efficiency improvements—given a geographical 
imbalance in freight flows; growing lightweight 
and low-density freight (McKinnon 2010); and 
the increasing adoption of NEV trucks (Qiu et 
al. 2020), which will affect HDTs’ operational 
efficiency—it is possible to achieve the level of 
operational efficiency in the Structural Change 
scenario. For example, Mulholland et al. (2018) 
show that average loads of HDTs increase with 
a country’s average income due to the shift from 
straight trucks to tractor trailers and combination 
trucks for long-haul transportation. Additional

China and the EU, heavy-duty trucks refer to trucks with GVWs over 12 tonnes; in the United States, heavy-duty trucks include only combination trucks (class 8 tractor trailers).

measures China could use to improve road freight 
operational efficiency include encouraging the 
use of non-truck operating carriers, facilitating 
drop-and-hook operations, and promoting 
standardization of trucks and pallets (Agenbroad 
et al. 2016).  
3.2.3 Technology deployment
Low-carbon vehicle technologies (or fuels)
The low-carbon transition in China’s vehicle fleet is 
rapidly underway (Table 8 and Figure 15). 
New energy vehicles (NEVs)—including 
battery electric vehicles, plug-in electric 
vehicles (PHEVs), and fuel cell electric 
vehicles (FCEVs)—are becoming mainstream 
technologies in buses and being increasingly 
adopted for use in private cars. 
 ▪ NEV buses had a 55 percent fleet penetration 
by the end of 2020, rising rapidly from 
2012’s 3 percent. NEV taxis are also gaining 
market momentum, representing 9 percent 
of fleet penetration. 
 ▪ Although NEV private cars had a 1 percent fleet 
penetration by the end of 2020, the market share 
Sources:  Historic data are based on NBS (2021). Projections are WRI authors’ calculations.
Figure  14  |   China’s Heavy-Duty Truck Fleet Size Projections (2020–60) under Different Scenarios 
of NEV sales soared: NEVs accounted for 15.7 
percent of passenger car retail sales in 2021, more 
than double 2020’s 6 percent (CAAM 2022). 
 ▪ By contrast, the fleet penetrations and market 
shares of NEVs remain low for light-duty and 
heavy-duty trucks: NEVs account for 0–1 
percent of heavy-duty truck and light-duty truck 
fleet penetration, and 1 percent market share in 
their respective annual sales.   
NG vehicles are common for commercial fleets: 
They have 55 percent of the taxi fleet penetration 
and 18 percent of the bus fleet penetration. They 
are increasingly adopted by the trucking industry 
(5 percent of the heavy-duty fleet penetration in 
2020), and the market share of liquefied natural 
gas (LNG) trucks in heavy-duty truck sales tripled 
from 2.4 percent in 2015 to 8.5 percent in 2020 
(Autoinfo 2021).   
Not all alternative vehicles/fuels are popular, 
especially biofuels. Unlike in the United States 
where most of the gasoline sold is blended with 
10–15 percent ethanol (by volume), biofuels 
are the least-adopted type of fuel in China. At 
present, biofuels—especially ethanol—are applied 
mostly to the taxi fleet, with 11 percent of the fleet 
powered by ethanol.

First, the future technology pathways are country-
specific and vehicle segment-specific. Particularly, 
controversies lie in the plausibility of using 
“transitional technologies.” For example, some 
studies argue that despite their inferior environmental 
performance, the transitional technologies are 
necessary near-term options for China: 
 ▪ LNG trucks: 50 percent fleet penetration in 
2050 (LBNL 2021) 
 ▪ Biofuels: 32 percent of transport energy 
consumption in 2050 (Pan et al. 2018)
 ▪ Hybrid trucks: 40 percent of annual sales by 
2060 (iCET 2021) 
Considering the infrastructure investment needs 
and useful lives of vehicles, this study gave only 
limited consideration to transitional technologies: 
 ▪ For passenger cars and light-duty trucks, we 
focused on battery electric vehicles (BEVs) because 
of the dominance of BEVs in market shares. For 
passenger cars, China’s ratio of BEVs in passenger 
NEV sales has been around 80 percent since 
2016, higher than the EU’s 45–51 percent (ACEA 
2021) and the United States’ 54–78 percent (BTS 
2021b). For trucks, BEVs are more predominant, 
accounting for 99.1 percent of NEV truck sales 
in 2020. Increasing numbers of regions such as 
the United Kingdom; California, United States; 
and Hong Kong have placed PHEVs together 
with ICE vehicles to be phased out because of 
their suboptimal environmental performance 
(Wappelhorst 2021). Following the same rationale, 
PHEVs receive less focus in this study. 
 ▪ For heavy-duty trucks, this study covers LNG 
trucks given their increasing market popularity. 
Hybrid heavy-duty trucks are not considered 
because the fuel economy advantage of hybrid 
heavy-duty trucks is not evident for long-haul 
HDTs. In China, 47 percent of the daily VKTs of 
long-haul HDTs were fulfilled on highways (RIOH 
and Sinoiov 2021) with an average speed of 57 km 
per hour. The fuel savings of HDTs over highway 
cycles were only 3–6 percent compared with 30 
percent fuel savings over city driving cycles (Gao 
et al. 2015). Further, limited hybrid models are 
available in China’s market: There were only three 
hybrid models sold in 2020 (iCET 2021).   
 ▪ For all the vehicle segments, biofuels are not 
considered. See Appendix C to learn why.
Second, the projected growth in NEV sales is 
likely to follow an S-curve (Abramczyk et al. 2017) 
whereby growth is slow when the technology is 
new, but as costs fall and infrastructure expands, 
a tipping point is reached and sales then grow 
exponentially. The S-curves differ by vehicle 
segment, with NEV buses reaching the tipping point 
and other segments still situated at the early stages 
of their S-curves (Table 10). This study uses the 
timing of total cost of ownership parity and public 
incentives to derive the possible tipping points for 
NEVs by vehicle segment.

Decarbonizing China’s Road Transport Sector: Strategies toward Carbon Neutrality
33
For passenger cars, evidence shows that the 
tipping point is approaching. For example, NEVs 
accounted for 20 percent of China’s passenger car 
sales in November 2021 (CAAM 2021b), meeting 
the 20 percent target set in China’s New Energy 
Vehicle Industrial Development Plan for 2021 
to 2035 five years early (State Council 2020). 
Further, without public subsidies, the TCO parity 
of BEVs and ICE private cars would be reached 
between 2024 and 2030, xi where compact cars 
would reach parity earlier (in 2024–25) and sport 
utility vehicles (SUVs) with large battery sizes 
would reach parity during 2025–30 (Lutsey et al. 
2021; see Appendix B). 
This study assumes the following: 
 ▪ The growth curve of the NEV market share 
in the Stated Policy scenario aligns with the 
nonbinding targets set in China’s Technology 
Roadmap for Energy-Saving and New Energy 
Vehicles 2.0 (the Roadmap; China SAE 2020), 
where NEVs will account for 40 percent of 
passenger car sales by 2030, 50 percent by 
2035, and 100 percent by 2060. 
 ▪ The growth curve of the NEV market share in 
the Deep Electrification scenario aligns with 
the Paris Climate Agreement–compatible 
sectoral target, where BEVs are targeted to 
account for 100 percent of passenger car 
sales by 2035 (NCI and CA 2020). To achieve 
the Paris Agreement–compatible sectoral 
target, policy interventions such as enhanced 
fleet-wide fuel consumption standards, road 
access privileges, and increased infrastructure 
accessibility are necessary.  
For buses, with tremendous public subsidies, 
even though the TCO of BEV buses has not 
achieved cost parity with diesel buses (World 
Bank 2021), NEV buses have gained momentum 
in the country, accounting for over 90 percent 
of the annual bus sales since 2016. Therefore, 
this study assumes NEV buses will account for 
100 percent of the market share starting in 2021 
across all scenarios.
For light-duty trucks: Although the current 1 
percent market share of NEV light-duty trucks 
is far from the 80 percent target set in China’s 
NEV Industrial Development Plan 2021–2035, 
light-duty trucks are edging toward the tipping 
point. The return-to-base nature and limited 
daily mileage of light-duty trucks used for urban 
deliveries make them ideal for electrification 
following buses. For example, with subsidies and 
preferential road access policies, 100 percent of the 
annually registered light-duty trucks are now NEVs 
in Shenzhen. Even without subsidies, the TCO 
parity of BEV light-duty trucks and ICE light-duty 
trucks will be reached in 2024–25 (see Appendix 
B). Therefore, this study assumes 100 percent 
market share of NEVs would be possible from 2035 
across all scenarios.
For heavy-duty trucks: Due to technology 
constraints, xii a fragmented trucking industry 
(Qiu et al. 2020), relatively late timelines for 
TCO parity (Mao et al. 2021), and a lack of policy 
incentives (Xue et al. 2019), NEV HDTs should 
reach the market tipping point later than other 
vehicle segments.  
Within HDTs, vehicles of different payloads and 
applied in different duty cycles have varying 
decarbonization paces: Straight trucks and dump 
trucks commonly used for urban deliveries, drayage, 
and regional operations with daily mileages below 
200 kilometers could be sooner transitioned to 
zero emissions (reaching TCO parity by 2023–25 
in China), and for these types of trucks and duty 
cycles, BEV technology is sufficient. However, for 
long-haul HDTs (with daily mileages over 200 
kilometers and sometimes up to 1,000 kilometers) 
and temperature-controlled refrigerated HDTs, 
the transition would occur more slowly (reaching 
TCO parity by 2030–35). For these types of trucks 
and duty cycles, FCEV technology would be needed 
(Mao et al. 2021; DOT 2021; Agora Energiewende 
2020a; Ledna et al. 2022). 
At present, China’s statistical system does not 
classify HDTs by operational duty cycle. For 
simplicity, this study assumes that all tractor 
trailers weighing above 30 tonnes are long-haul 
vehicles, though straight trucks are also used 
for long-haul shipments in China. Given this 
assumption, long-haul HDTs and refrigerated 
HDTs represent about 50 percent of the current 
HDT fleet, while straight trucks and dump trucks 
used in short-range duty cycles represent the

34
WRI.org.cn
remaining 50 percent (Figure 16). This fleet mix is 
assumed to be stable over time. 
In the Stated Policy scenario, although NDRC (2021) 
(the Action Plan) sets a mandatory target that 
clean-energy vehicles, which include NEVs and NG 
vehicles, represent 40 percent of annual vehicle sales 
in 2030, this target is ambiguous as to the specific 
share of NEVs for the truck segment. Therefore, the 
nonbinding targets set in the Roadmap, which were 
based on consultations with the truck manufacturing 
industry, are used in this study, where NEV trucks 
account for 17 percent of annual truck sales in 2030. 
This study further assumes that starting in 2050, all 
new HDTs operating in urban deliveries, drayage, 
and regional delivery duty cycles will be zero-
emission vehicles, comprising 50 percent of HDT 
sales and 49 percent of the HDT stock.  
In the Deep Electrification scenario, considering 
HDTs have 4–10 years of useful life (Mao et al. 
2021), to achieve net zero by 2060, ICE HDTs 
(including diesel trucks and NG trucks) should stop 
being sold no later than 2050. This means not only 
100 percent of the new HDTs operating in the urban 
delivery, drayage, and regional delivery duty cycles 
will be zero emissions, but also 100 percent of the 
new long-haul HDTs and refrigerated HDTs will be 
zero emissions from 2050 (Figure 17). For the latter, 
FCEV technology would be necessary. This ambitious

target could be achieved through measures such as 
increasing vehicle acquisition subsidies (although 
China aims to phase out the national NEV purchase 
subsidies from 2023, subsidies to NEV HDTs 
should be maintained), introducing HDT operation 
subsidies, establishing fleet-wide fuel consumption 
standards for HDTs, adopting CO2 emission–based 
road pricing, providing road access privileges 
for NEV HDTs, and improving infrastructure 
accessibility and convenience.
Fuel efficiency improvements
China is among the few developing countries with 
comprehensive and stringent requirements for 
vehicle fuel consumption (Table 10): Every vehicle 
manufactured in or imported to China is subject to 
the fuel consumption limits; further, vehicle original 
equipment manufacturers (OEMs) must meet the 
corporate average fuel consumption (CAFC) targets, 
where the accrued CAFC (and NEV) credits can be 
traded among OEMs under the Parallel Management 
Regulation for CAFC and NEV Credits.

Source: WRI authors, based on existing policies and standards. 
With stricter requirements, China’s fleet-average 
fuel consumption—that is, the average fuel 
consumption of all the cars registered in China 
including ICE vehicles and NEVs—has been 
improving. The fleet-average fuel consumption 
for passenger cars declined from 6.5 L/100 km 
(New European Driving Cycle) in 2016 to 5.61 
L/100 km in 2020, approaching the 5 L/100 km 
target for 2020 (CATARC 2021). With the Phase V 
fleet-average fuel consumption target of 4 L/100 
km for 2025—95 grams of CO 2 per kilometer (g/
km) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test 
Procedure; WLTP)—China’s fleet-average fuel 
consumption for passenger cars will be catching up 
with the EU’s 95 g/km (WLTP) target for 2024 (EU 
P&C 2019).
Despite the improvement in fleet-average fuel 
consumption (including NEVs), the average 
fuel consumption for ICE vehicles alone has not 
significantly improved. This is because fleet-
average fuel consumption is discounted by the 
increased NEV production, where OEMs meet the

CAFC target by increasing the production of NEVs 
while not greatly improving ICE vehicles’ fuel 
consumption levels (ICCT 2019). Consequently, 
although the fleet-average fuel consumption for 
passenger cars (including NEVs) in China dropped 
13 percent from 2016 to 2020, the average fuel 
consumption for ICE vehicles decreased by only 7 
percent (CATARC 2016, 2021).   
In fact, ICE vehicles have an untapped potential 
for fuel consumption improvements. For 
passenger cars, the 4 L/100 km fleet-average 
target can be met by ICE vehicles alone. 
Particularly, hybrid vehicle adoption could be 
accelerated in China: In 2020, hybrid vehicles 
represented only 2.6 percent of car sales in 
China, behind the EU’s 11.9 percent (ACEA 2021). 
According to the targets in the Roadmap set by 
industrial experts, hybrid cars would account 
for 50–60 percent of ICE car sales in 2025 and 
100 percent in 2035 in China. For ICE HDTs, 
as predicted in the Roadmap, China can further 
reduce HDTs’ fuel consumption by 20 percent in 
2035 by improving aerodynamics and the thermal 
efficiency of engines, among other measures 
(Figure 18). 
Energy efficiency improvements for NEVs are 
equally crucial (Gao et al. 2019). Although 
China established the world’s first standard on 
electric vehicles’ energy consumption limits 
for passenger NEVs, the energy efficiency 
of the commercial NEV fleet is unregulated. 
With increased gross vehicle weights (GVWs), 
some commercial NEVs have seen increases in 
energy consumption. For example, according 
to the Annual Report on the Big Data of New 
Energy Vehicles in China (2021) (Z.P. Wang et 
al. 2021), the fleet-average energy consumption 
of BEV buses in China increased by 10 percent 
from 2018 to 2020. Therefore, this study 
assumes future efficiency improvements will 
occur for commercial NEVs, with the degree of 
improvement based on a literature review—that 
is, the median values of energy consumption 
rates in existing studies (see Figure 19).

In this study, we used the nonbinding targets 
for ICE vehicles in the Stated Policy scenario. 
Considering the targets in the Stated Policy scenario 
are already ambitious, we developed the BAU 
scenario—with no fuel consumption improvements 
for ICE vehicles or NEVs—to reflect the case when 
the targets in the Stated Policy scenario are not met. 
For this study, we used real-world fuel consumption 
instead of certified fuel consumption. Because 
type-approval driving cyclesxiii differ from real-world 
driving conditions and vehicles with larger GVWsxiv 
are increasing in the fleet mix, the real-world fleet-
average fuel consumption of ICE vehicles is larger 
than certified fuel consumption. From 2008 to 2017, 
China’s real-world fleet-average fuel consumption 
for ICE cars was 8.6 L/100 km (iCET 2017), meaning 
that not only did real-world fuel consumption not 
improve over the past decade, but it was also 30% 
higher than certificated consumption. Therefore, to 
capture true fuel use, the study used the real-world 
fuel consumption estimated in COPERT (see Section 
2.2.1) for the base year and assumed that, in the 
future, the gap between real-world fuel consumption 
and certified fuel consumption will close.    
3.2.4 Grid and hydrogen decarbonization   
Because coal is the major feedstock for electricity 
and hydrogen generation in China, how electricity 
and hydrogen are generated play a role in road 
transport decarbonization. According to the China 
Electricity Council, nearly 61 percent of China’s 
electricity generation was sourced from coal in

Because of China’s heavy reliance on coal for 
power and hydrogen generation, the current 
decarbonization potential of NEVs is limited, 
particularly for the energy-intensive heavy-duty 
NEVs. Taking a 40-tonne tractor trailer as an 
example (see Figure 21), a BEV tractor trailer 
saves 25 percent WTW CO2 emissions per 100 km 
travelled compared with the WTW emissions of 
ICE vehicles. These emissions savings are less than 
the 59 percent savings from a NEV passenger car 
versus an ICE passenger car. Further, the emissions 
savings for FCEVs are more insignificant: The WTW 
emissions from a FCEV tractor trailer are almost 
identical to the WTW emissions of an ICE tractor 
trailer and even 11 percent higher than the tailpipe 
emissions of an ICE tractor trailer.  
To decarbonize the transport sector, the power sector 
and hydrogen-related industry must be decarbonized 
simultaneously. In the Stated Policy scenario, 
we used the existing decarbonization roadmaps 
announced in China’s policy directives and those 
proposed by industrial alliances (Figure 22):
 ▪ Power sector decarbonization roadmap: In 
the near term, according to NDRC (2021),

Note:  •   The energy consumption of tractor trailers is 34 L/100 km for ICE vehicles, 150 kWh/100 km for BEVs, and 8.5 kg/100 km for FCEVs. That of passenger cars (sport utility vehicles) is 
8.6 L/100 km for ICE vehicles and 16.5 kWh/100 km for BEVs, and the energy consumption of buses is 38 L/100 km for ICE vehicles and 109 kWh/100 km for BEVs.

loss and charging loss is assumed for BEVs.

China’s coal consumption will peak in the 14 th 
five-year period (2021–25), and the installed 
capacities of wind and solar will reach over 
1,200 gigawatts. Over the long term, based on 
China’s Long-Term Low-Carbon Development 
Strategies and Pathways (ICCSD 2020), coal 
should represent 6.5 percent of China’s power 
generation by 2050.

on China’s Hydrogen Energy Carrier and 
Fuel Cell Stack Industry (CHA 2019), the 
market share of China’s domestic green 
hydrogen (water electrolysis using 100 
percent renewable energy) production will 
grow from 1 percent in 2020 to 70 percent in 
2050. The share of domestic gray hydrogen 
production will drop to 15 percent, in which

steam methane reforming and industrial

percent and 5 percent. Coal gasification 
facilities will be completely decommissioned 
before 2050. 
The stated policies are already ambitious. If these 
targets for power mix and hydrogen production 
mix can be met, WTW emissions of NEVs will 
drop to nearly zero in 2050 (see Figure 23). As 
a benchmark, a less-ambitious BAU scenario 
(see Table 11) helps us evaluate the emission 
reduction potential of the stated policies and the 
consequences of not meeting these targets. In 
the BAU scenario, a fraction of fossil fuels would 
remain in power generation (25 percent) and 
hydrogen production processes (50 percent) (F.Q.

3.2.5 Summary
We modelled five scenarios in this study: the 
Business as Usual scenario, the Stated Policy 
scenario, and three enhanced scenarios—
Structural Change, Deep Electrification, and Deep 
Decarbonization (Table 12).  
The BAU scenario is a counterfactual scenario, 
featured by no improvements in energy efficiency 
and limited degrees of vehicle electrification. 
This scenario helps evaluate the decarbonization 
potential of the country’s stated policies by revealing 
the consequences of not achieving them.   
The Stated Policy scenario projects emissions based 
on the intermediary targets and policies planned 
by the national government and nonbinding 
targets proposed by industrial associations. As 
demonstrated in Sections 3.2.3 and 3.2.4, the 
stated policies are ambitious for fuel efficiency 
improvement measures and power-sector and 
hydrogen-related-sector decarbonization, but 
less ambitious for structural changes and vehicle 
electrification. Therefore, in addition to the Stated 
Policy scenario (“Stated_policy”), we constructed 
three forecasting scenarios: 
 ▪ The Structural Change scenario (“Low_
stock”) is based on the Stated_policy scenario 
but assumes greater degrees of mode shift 
and vehicle occupancy improvements. As a 
result, the scenario is characterized by smaller

 ▪ The Deep Electrification scenario (“DeepELE”) 
is based on the Stated_policy scenario but 
involves a more rapid diffusion of NEVs—that 
is, NEVs will represent 100 percent of passenger 
car sales by 2035 and 100 percent of HDT sales 
(including long-haul HDTs and refrigerated 
HDTs) by 2050.  
 ▪ The Deep Decarbonization scenario 
(“DeepDecarb”) is based on the Stated_policy 
scenario but integrates the Low_stock and 
DeepELE scenarios. Therefore, the scenario 
represents the most ambitious case that 
is conducive to attaining China’s carbon 
neutrality target.

RESULTS
CHAPTER 4
This chapter includes our projections for China road 
transport's GHG emissions, energy usage, petroleum 
consumption, and air pollutant emissions up to 2060 under 
different scenarios. It also evaluates the decarbonization 
and air pollution reduction potentials of different measures 
and identifies what policies are cost effective to meet 
China's 2060 carbon neutrality commitment.

4.1 Base Year Calibration 
The base year of the study is 2020, when the most 
recent statistical data are available. Despite the decrease 
in transport activities and emissions during the forced 
lockdown period for COVID-19 from February to April 
2020 (Le Quéré 2020), China experienced only slightly 
affected road freight volumes, increased private car 
purchases, and temporarily lower transit ridership 
during that time (Zhou et al. 2020).    
Using the bottom-up approach (see Section 2.2), 
we estimated the base year’s GHG emissions. 
We verified the results with the top-down 
estimates that were derived based on the fossil 
fuel consumption from China’s energy balance 
using the methodology outlined in Su (2017). We 
reconciled the difference between the top-down 
and bottom-up estimates by adjusting vehicle 
kilometers travelled, following the recommended 
procedure in IPCC (2006). 
For the base year, we calculated and compared 
the GHG emissions of three emissions scopes: 
TTW GHG emissions (the emissions from vehicle 
operations), WTW_ele emissions (the TTW 
emissions and upstream emissions from the 
production of electricity and hydrogen), and the 
full scope of WTW emissions. 
The results show the following: TTW GHG emissions 
were 1,168 Mt CO2eq in 2020, almost identical to 
the WTW_ele emissions (1,186 Mt CO2eq) (Figure 
24). This is due to limited NEV penetration now. In 
contrast, the full scope of WTW GHG emissions was 
19 percent higher than TTW emissions as emissions 
from the oil refinery and gas processing industries 
are included in WTW emissions. Regardless of the 
emissions scope, CO2 accounted for the majority 
(96–97 percent) of the GHG emissions.
Contributions to GHG emissions and air pollutants 
varied across vehicle segments (see Figure 25):
 ▪ CO2 emissions: With a large fleet size (70 percent 
of the vehicle stock), private cars contributed the 
largest share of WTW_ele CO2 emissions (40 
percent). Following private cars were heavy-
duty trucks (35 percent of CO2 emissions) and 
light-duty trucks (17 percent of CO2 emissions). 
Notably, heavy-duty trucks’ 35 percent CO2 
emissions contribution is disproportionate to its 
relatively small fleet size (3 percent of the vehicle

stock). Although motorcycles represented 20 
percent of the vehicle stock, their corresponding 
CO2 emissions were insignificant.
 ▪ CH4 emissions: High methane emissions were 
observed for fleets with relatively large shares 
of NG vehicles, including heavy-duty trucks 
(51 percent), buses (18 percent), and taxis (15 
percent). This is because of the high methane 
emissions typically associated with NG vehicles 
(Pan et al. 2020). 
 ▪ N2O emissions were primarily attributable to 
diesel vehicles—heavy-duty trucks (51 percent) 
and light-duty trucks (21 percent).  
 ▪ Air pollutants: Private cars contributed the 
largest share of CO (40 percent) and NMHC (60 
percent) emissions, and fossil fuel–powered 
motorcycles’ NMHC emissions were also 
considerable (13 percent). Heavy-duty trucks 
and light-duty trucks were the major sources of 
toxic NOx and PM emissions.     
4.2 Scenario Projections
This section includes our projections for WTW_
ele GHG emissions, energy usage, petroleum 
consumption, and air pollutant emissions up to 
2060 under different scenarios. 
We did not consider the full scope of WTW emissions 
because decarbonizing the oil refinery and gas 
processing industries is difficult and involves 
different policy recommendations. However, we did 
consider emissions from the production of electricity 
and hydrogen because it is still unclear if switching 
to electricity and hydrogen should count as low 
carbon when power and hydrogen production is not 
decarbonized (Gustafsson et al. 2021). 
4.2.1 GHG emissions 
Results from the scenario analysis suggest the 
following (see Figure 26 and Table 13):
In the near term, the growth in road transport 
GHG emissions should continue. The likely peak

years of road transport’s GHG emissions are 
between 2025 and 2035, with peak GHG emissions 
ranging from 1,340 Mt CO2eq (13 percent increase 
from 2020) to 1,909 Mt CO2eq (61 percent increase 
from 2020). The Stated_policy scenario suggests 
that if China implements the stated policies outlined 
by the government and targets set by industrial 
associations, the road transport sector’s GHG 
emissions are likely to peak by 2030 at 1,638 Mt 
CO2eq. The Low_stock and DeepELE scenarios 
indicate that with enhanced measures such as 
structural changes and vehicle electrification, the 
peak year would be advanced to 2026 and 2028, 
respectively, and peak GHG emissions would 
be lower—1,358 Mt CO 2eq and 1,585 Mt CO2eq, 
respectively. Of note is that in the near term, 
structural changes are more effective at peaking 
emissions earlier and reducing emissions to a 
greater extent than vehicle electrification.   
In the long term, GHG emissions in 2060 vary 
widely based on the scenario, ranging from 63 
Mt CO2eq (a 95 percent decrease from 2020) to 
1,495 Mt CO2eq (a 26 percent increase from 2020). 
Among the policy scenarios, the Stated_policy 
scenario shows that if the stated policies are 
effectively implemented over time, China’s road 
transport GHG emissions would be 50 percent 
lower than in 2020. If additional measures 
such as structural changes and higher degrees 
of vehicle electrification are taken, as assumed 
with the DeepDecarb scenario, road transport 
emissions could be mitigated by 95 percent 
compared with 2020’s level. Over the long term, 
vehicle electrification would surpass structural 
changes to become the measure with the highest 
decarbonization potential. 
CH4 and N2O demonstrate slightly different 
pathways because both CH 4 and N2O are not 
only GHG emissions, but also regulated air 
pollutants, subject to China’s vehicle exhaust 
emission standards. Unlike other pollutants (See 
Section 4.2.3 and Figure 27), in the BAU scenario, 
neither CH 4 emissions nor N 2O emissions decline 
significantly after the implementation of the

China 6 standard in 2020: CH 4 emissions initially 
drop from 2020 to 2030 due to the enforcement 
of China 6 but rebound after 2030 because 
the increasing adoption of NG vehicles offsets 
the decrease in per-vehicle NG emissions; the 
limited drop in N 2O emissions occurs because the 
deployment of aftertreatment systems in diesel 
vehicles to meet China 6’s NOx emissions limit 
would lead to increased N 2O emissions (Clairotte 
et al. 2020). Therefore, as suggested by the 
DeepELE and DeepDecarb scenarios, in addition 
to relying on tightening emission exhaust 
standards, vehicle electrification can control CH 4 
and N2O emissions.
4.2.2 Energy demand 
Energy demand in the road transport sector will 
experience drastic changes, both in terms of 
absolute energy volumes and the energy mix.  
The increased penetration of NEVs will 
substantially cut road transport’s demand for fossil 
fuels (gasoline, diesel, and natural gas) (see Figures 
28 and 29):
 ▪ Petroleum demand could peak earlier than the 
2030 target set in NDRC (2021). In the Stated_
policy scenario, the country’s petroleum demand 
will peak in 2027, the same peak year for global 
petroleum demand forecasted by BloombergNEF 
(2021). The peak year would occur even sooner 
(2024–25) in the Low_stock, Deep_ELE, 
and DeepDecarb scenarios with reinforced 
decarbonization measures such as structural 
changes and vehicle electrification. In all the 
policy scenarios, petroleum consumption in 2060 
would be 66–100 percent lower than in 2020, 
showing that the country’s road transport sector 
will be less dependent on petroleum (petroleum 
use would be fully eliminated in 2060 in the 
Deep_ELE and DeepDecarb scenarios).

 ▪ Future demand for natural gas is more 
precarious: If NG vehicles play a significant role 
in meeting the clean energy vehicle sales target 
of 40 percent in 2030, the demand for natural 
gas will peak in 2060, with peak demand a 
179 percent increase over 2020’s level (see the 
Stated_policy and Low_stock scenarios); if NG 
vehicles are not recommended and are soon 
displaced by NEVs, the demand for natural gas 
would peak in 2024–26 and follow petroleum’s 
path to be eliminated in 2060 (see the Deep_
ELE and DeepDecarb scenarios). 
By contrast, the growth in electricity and hydrogen 
demand would follow a strong upward trend. The 
electricity demand in 2060 varies between 2.8 
billion gigajoules (GJ) and 6.2 billion GJ, and 
hydrogen demand between 0.4 billion GJ and 3.3 
billion GJ (Figure 30). 
Noteworthy is that a smaller NEV fleet would lead 
to less electricity and hydrogen demand. In the 
DeepDecarb scenario, electricity consumption in 
2060 would be 24 percent lower and hydrogen 
demand 39 percent lower than in the DeepELE

scenario (see Table 14). Therefore, managing 
vehicle ownership and usage is critical to lessening 
investments in installed capacity for power and 
hydrogen generation. 
4.2.3 Air pollutants
Unlike GHG emissions and energy consumption, 
future emissions from air pollutants would keep 
declining across all the scenarios that decouple from 
GHG emission trajectories (see Figure 31). 
Even under the BAU scenario, all the regulated air 
pollutants exhibit varying degrees of reduction, 
in which NOx emissions in 2060 decline by 73 
percent from the 2020 level, PM by 84 percent, 
NMHC by 90 percent, and CO by 41 percent. This 
is mainly attributable to the enforcement of the 
China 6 standard for all vehicles starting in 2021 
and the increasing adoption of end-of-pipe control 
measures (see Box 2). If the China 6 standard is 
not enforced, China will experience growing NOx, 
NMHC, and CO emissions (Figure 32).   
Although nationwide, air pollutants from the road 
transport sector will be effectively controlled, 
sustained pollution abatement efforts are needed 
for a few reasons. First, air pollutants are local, 
and it is likely that regions with dense populations 
would still be exposed to significant vehicular 
emissions and high health risks. With the World 
Health Organization’s new and stricter Global Air 
Quality Guidelines (WHO 2021), China’s battle 
against air pollution is expected to continue. 
Second, besides the road transport sector, non-
road transport sectors such as shipping and non-
road machinery are also primary sources of air 
pollutants that require attention (Feng et al. 2019; 
Shao 2021). Third, although we did not consider 
any next-generation China exhaust emission 
standard (such as a Euro 7 equivalent) or an ultra-
low emissions requirement for NOx emissions (see 
Box 2), the benefits of a tougher standard on NEV 
promotion and air quality improvement should not 
be underrated by policymakers (ACEA 2022).

Box  2  |   China’s End-of-Pipe Emission Control Standards
China’s vehicle exhaust emission standards have evolved rapidly 
over the past 20 years from China 1 to China 6. Now, China 6 is 
one of the most stringent emission standards in the world, with 
the air pollutant limits in China 6a (the standard for light-duty 
vehicles was effective as of 2020, and that for heavy-duty trucks 
as of 2021) equating to those of Euro 6 (see Figure B2.1 for an 
example of limits for diesel HDTs). After China 6b becomes 
effective in 2023, the emission limits will be even lower than 
those in Euro 6.a 
However, other global emission regulations show that there is 
still room for improvement in China’s emission standard. For 
example, compared with the NOx limit (0.27 g/kWh) mandated 
by the United States’ 2010 emission standard for HDTs, China 
6’s limit (0.4 g/kWh) is still on the higher end. Further, with 
California’s adoption of the Heavy-Duty Engine and Vehicle 
Omnibus Regulation in 2020, which mandates a further 90 
percent reduction of NOx emissions from HDTs from 2024 to 2027 , 
the difference in NOx limits will be widened.

4.3.1  Decarbonization potentials of different 
measures
This section evaluates the decarbonization 
potentials of different measures and identifies 
what policies are needed to meet the 2060 carbon 
neutrality commitment. 
Attribution analysis 1: From BAU to Stated_
policy  
The model results reveal that compared with the 
BAU scenario, stated policies would offer a 21,404 
Mt CO2eq cumulative emission reduction from 2020 
to 2060. Among these policies, vehicle electrification 
measures offer the largest emission reduction 
(10,092 Mt CO2eq), followed by improvements to 
vehicle fuel efficiency (7,003 Mt CO2eq) and power 
(and hydrogen) sector decarbonization (4,309 Mt 
CO2eq). Realizing these decarbonization potentials 
is contingent upon successfully implementing the 
stated policies (Figure 33 and Table 15).

Attribution analysis 2: From Stated_policy 
to DeepDecarb  
To further cut emissions from the level in the Stated_
policy scenario to that in the DeepDecarb scenario, 
this study shows that China’s road transport sector 
needs more ambitious targets on vehicle electrification 
and structural changes (see Figure 34 and Table 16). 
Compared with the Stated_policy scenario,
 ▪ higher vehicle electrification targets—including 
100 percent NEVs in passenger car sales by 2035 
and 100 percent NEVs in long-haul HDT sales 
and refrigerated HDT sales by 2050—would be 
instrumental to delivering an additional 11,007 
Mt CO2eq cumulative emission reduction; and 
 ▪ explicit and radical structural change targets—
including 40 percent of road freight in the total tkm 
and an average 11.5 tonne load per HDT vehicle-
kilometer—would be key to delivering an additional 
7,175 Mt CO2eq cumulative emission reduction. 
Altogether, decarbonizing the freight sector offers 
the largest emission reduction potential of 12,568 
Mt CO2eq.

Attribution analysis 3: From BAU to 
DeepDecarb  
To bend the emission curve from that in the BAU 
scenario to that in the DeepDecarb scenario, 
three decarbonization measures must occur in the 
country’s road transport sector (see Figure 35):
 ▪ Vehicle electrification—especially for heavy- 
and light-duty trucks—has the largest 
decarbonization potential over the long term, 
contributing to 48 percent of the cumulative 
GHG emission reduction from 2020 to 2060. 
If the carbon intensity of upstream power/
hydrogen generation is reduced simultaneously, 
vehicle electrification could result in a 60 
percent cumulative emission reduction.    
 ▪ Structural changes and fuel efficiency 
improvements are the second- and third-
most effective measures to be undertaken, 
respectively. Structural change measures 
have the second-largest mitigation potential 
over the long term—by managing vehicle fleet 
growth and kilometers travelled, cumulative 
GHG emissions from 2020 to 2060 could 
be cut by 23 percent. Energy efficiency 
improvements could generate a 17 percent 
cumulative emission reduction; tightening 
the fleet-wide fuel efficiency standard also has 
the benefit of stimulating NEV production 
(Wappelhorst et al. 2021).

However, these instruments have varying mitigation 
potentials over time:
 ▪ In the near term (2020–35), structural changes 
have the largest mitigation potential because 
the adoption of NEVs will have not yet reached 
a tipping point. 
 ▪ Over the long term (2035–60), the uptake 
of NEVs will overtake structural changes 
to have the largest mitigation potential. To 
unlock the long-term abatement potential of 
vehicle electrification, technology advances 
are necessary, particularly the development of 
zero-emission technologies on long-haul HDTs 
and refrigerated HDTs (currently, two to five 
times more expensive than ICE HDTs) as well 
as low-cost technologies for green hydrogen 
production and distribution (currently, three to 
four times more expensive than gray hydrogen) 
(IRENA 2020). 
From a sectoral perspective, freight transport 
would play a more important role than passenger 
transport. Concretely, attaining the carbon 
neutrality goal requires a radical shift in truck fleet 
technologies and freight structures:
 ▪ Truck electrification (both light- and 
heavy-duty trucks) would need to result 
in a reduction of 12,524 Mt of cumulative 
emissions—nearly two times the emission

reduction associated with passenger vehicle 
electrification. Particularly, technologies and 
policies need to tackle the hard-to-abate long-
haul HDTs and refrigerated HDTs. 
 ▪ Freight transport’s structural changes would need 
to result in a reduction of 6,844 Mt of cumulative 
GHG emissions—nearly three times the emission 
reduction associated with passenger transport’s 
structural changes. Particularly, explicit freight 
structural change targets and coordinated policies 
are needed to facilitate the transition. 
Further, to inform decarbonization policymaking in 
the freight sector, China needs better statistical data 
systems on commodity flows (by mode, distance, 
and origin/destination pairs) as well as HDT fleet 
breakdowns by operational duty cycles.
Attribution analysis 4: Decarbonization 
potential of NG vehicles
NG vehicles account for a considerable fraction 
of China’s vehicle fleet. This study assumes that 
the CH4 TTW emission factor for China 5 heavy-
duty trucks is 3 percent of NG consumption, and 
the emission factor for China 6 heavy-duty trucks 
ranges from 0.4 to 1 percent of NG consumption 
based on on-road testing results (Pan et al. 2020). 
The estimated per-vehicle emissions show that the 
CO2 emissions from an LNG heavy-duty vehicle are 
20 percent lower than those from a diesel vehicle, 
but the GHG emission reduction potential of an 
LNG heavy-duty vehicle is less significant:
 ▪ For China 6 LNG heavy-duty vehicles, the TTW 
GHG emissions (20-year GWP) are 12 percent 
lower than those from a diesel vehicle when the 
TTW CH4 emission factor is 0.4 percent of NG 
consumption, and the GHG emissions are about 
the same as those of diesel vehicles when the 
TTW CH4 emission factor is 1 percent. 
 ▪ For China 5 LNG heavy-duty vehicles, the 
TTW GHG emissions are even higher than 
those from diesel vehicles as larger amounts 
of methane escape from China 5 vehicles (such 
as crankcase emissions and dynamic venting 
of the fuel system) that outweigh the CO 2 
emissions savings (Pan et al. 2020; Mottschall 
et al. 2020).
To evaluate the GHG emission implications of the 
expected promotion of NG vehicles, we compared 
the Stated_policy scenario with an NG scenario 
(see Figure 36). In the NG scenario, LNG heavy-
duty trucks meeting the China 6 emission standard 
represent 20 percent of the annual heavy-duty 
truck sales in 2030 (higher than the 15 percent 
in the Stated_policy scenario), and 50 percent in 
2050 (compared with the constant 15 percent in 
the Stated_policy scenario). The results show the 
following (see Figure 37):
 ▪ In 2060, a larger NG fleet in the NG scenario 
would result in an 11 percent further reduction 
in CO2 emissions and a less than 7 percent 
further reduction in GHG emissions compared 
with the Stated_policy scenario.  
 ▪ For cumulative emissions reductions from 2020 
to 2060, a larger fleet of LNG heavy-duty trucks 
in the NG scenario would lead to a 3 percent 
cumulative CO2 emission reduction compared 
with the Stated_policy scenario; the cumulative 
GHG emission reduction would be even lower, 
at less than 3 percent. 
In summary, the above analysis indicates that when 
the China 6 standard is stringently enforced and the 
real-world emissions of NG vehicles meet (or are 
lower than) the CH4 emission limit, an LNG heavy-
duty truck would result in an up to 20 percent CO2 
emission reduction and 12 percent GHG emission 
reduction compared with the emissions from a 
diesel truck. In the scenario analysis, when the 
market share of LNG heavy-duty trucks rises to 
50 percent in 2050 in the Stated_policy scenario 
(compared with the original 15 percent), the wider 
adoption of LNG trucks leads to 7 percent GHG 
emission reduction in 2060 and to a less than 3 
percent cumulative GHG emission reduction from 
2020 to 2060 compared with the Stated_policy 
scenario. If the upstream WTT emissions associated 
with NG processing are taken into account, the 
GHG emission reduction potential of NG vehicles 
would possibly further shrink (Pan et al. 2020).   
Apart from the limited environmental benefit, 
the widespread uptake of NG vehicles also raises 
concerns over NG import dependency, NG price 
affordability, and newly added NG infrastructure 
such as pipelines and storage reservoirs that could

60

soon become stranded assets when NEVs take hold. 
Therefore, China needs to scrutinize its 2030 clean 
energy vehicle target (40 percent) in the Action 
Plan to determine whether and to what extent NG 
vehicles should be promoted.

Decarbonizing China’s Road Transport Sector: Strategies toward Carbon Neutrality
61
4.3.2 Marginal abatement cost analysis 
Decarbonizing the transport sector requires 
making large investments in both traditional and 
emerging fields—from making railway and street 
improvements to acquiring NEVs and expanding 
the charging/refueling network. Studies suggest 
that to enable China’s net-zero transition, 90–174 
trillion CNY in cumulative low-carbon investments 
will need to be mobilized from 2020 to 2050 (BCG 
2020; ICCSD 2020; Goldman Sachs 2021). Across 
all sectors, the transport sector will attract the most 
investment according to BCG (2020), or the second 
most—following the power sector—according to 
ICCSD (2020). 
This study first evaluates the levels of low-carbon 
investment required to achieve the GHG emissions 
reduction in the different scenarios compared 
with those in the BAU scenario, using the method 
outlined in Section 2.2.2. Two types of low-carbon 
investments are considered, namely NEV promotion 
and infrastructure investments to facilitate 
structural changes. 
The results show that large low-carbon investments 
amounting to 39–83 trillion CNY cumulatively are 
needed from 2020 to 2060 (compared with the BAU 
scenario) to decarbonize China’s road transport 
sector. The levels of investment are greater than 
those found in BCG (2020), ICCSD (2020), and 
Goldman Sachs (2021) because we used a longer 
time frame and broader coverage of investments 
(Figure 38).xvi The investment demand is the largest 
from now till 2035 and will steadily decline over 
time. Among all the scenarios, the Low_stock 
scenario provides the lowest-cost mitigation 
pathway due to a smaller vehicle fleet (the average 
abatement cost is 675 CNY per tonne of CO2eq 
reduced). The DeepELE scenario is the highest-cost 
mitigation pathway, with an average abatement cost 
of about three times (2,510 CNY per tonne CO2eq 
reduced) the cost in the Low_stock scenario.

Further, we constructed marginal abatement cost 
curves (MACCs) to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 
the mitigation measures in the DeepDecarb scenario 
in comparison to the BAU scenario. As the abatement 
costs evolve rapidly over time, we chose to look at 
three snapshots—2025 (that is, the 14th five-year 
period), 2030, and 2050 (see Figures 39, 40, and 41, 
respectively). The three MACCs indicate the following:
 ▪ Structural changes and fuel efficiency 
improvements are consistently low-cost 
options. Compared with the BAU scenario, 
both measures offer considerable net cost 
savings. For example, although public transit 
and freight infrastructure are expensive, 
structural changes can lead to considerable 
cost savings for vehicle acquisition, operation, 
and charging/hydrogen infrastructure 
installation, owing to a smaller vehicle fleet. 
Consequently, the unit abatement costs of 
passenger and freight structural changes 
in 2030 are -14.7 CNY and -4.1 CNY per 
kilogram of GHG reduced, respectively (Figure 
40). Making fuel efficiency improvements 
is another cost-saving option, with a unit 
abatement cost of -4.0 CNY per kilogram 
in 2030. This is because cost-efficient ICE 
technologies to reduce fuel consumption (such 
as hybridization, new engine technologies, 
and vehicle downsizing) will have yet to be 
deployed at scale. The future fuel savings from 
ICE vehicles would be large enough to offset 
the rise in vehicle prices (to meet stricter fuel 
consumption standards) (Yang and Cui 2020). 
 ▪ Abatement costs change significantly for 
vehicle electrification. For example, the unit 
abatement cost of freight vehicle electrification 
declines from 81.9 CNY per kilogram in 2025 
to 5.8 CNY in 2030 and -0.6 CNY in 2050 
(Figures 39, 40, and 41, respectively). This is 
because from now until 2030, the lifetime TCO 
of NEV HDTs will remain high. Only after TCO 
parity is reached around 2030–35 will NEVs 
become an affordable option, exhibiting net 
cost savings compared with ICE vehicles.  
The following is noteworthy: 
 ▪ Although needed investments in public transit 
and freight railways are lower, investments 
alone do not lead to mode shift. Without 
complementary measures, solely making 
infrastructure investments would have the 
associated risk of leading to infrastructure 
underutilization, which would result in 
higher emissions than having highly utilized 
infrastructure (Spielmann et al. 2010; ITF 
2013). Therefore, comprehensive instruments 
such as travel demand management, MaaS, 
emission-based road pricing, and service quality 
improvements should be employed. 
 ▪ The high abatement costs of vehicle electrification 
should not deter relevant investments. In 
fact, investments in vehicle acquisition and 
infrastructure expansion are critical because only 
through economies of scale (as NEVs become 
more widely adopted) would NEV costs drop.

4.4  GHG Emissions and Air 
Pollutant Co-control 
Potentials
Measures with large decarbonization potentials at 
low cost do not necessarily produce air quality co-
benefits. 
To evaluate mitigation measures’ co-control 
potentials in reducing GHGs and air pollutants, we 
employed a “co-control effect coordinate system” 
(Hu et al. 2020). In the coordination system (see 
Figure 42), the vertical axis and the horizontal 
axis, respectively, represent the cumulative GHG 
emission reduction and cumulative air pollutant 
reduction compared with the BAU scenario. 
Mitigation measures falling in the third quadrant 
are the measures with co-control potential. We 
investigated cumulative emission reductions under 
two time frames—the near term (2020–35) and the 
long term (2035–60).
As shown in Figure 42, vehicle electrification 
and structural changes not only have the largest 
decarbonization potentials, but also the greatest 
potential to curb air pollution. However, not all 
GHG mitigation measures would deliver air quality 
co-benefits (Table 17):

 ▪ Limited co-control effects were found for 
fuel efficiency improvement measures—fuel 
efficiency improvements lead to GHG emission 
reductions but are neutral to air pollution 
control. In fact, in the real world, different 
energy-efficiency technologies lead to varying 
co-control effects. For example, hybrid 
(gasoline) vehicle technologies emit less GHG 
emissions and air pollutants, especially in urban 
driving conditions (O’Driscoll et al. 2018). By 
contrast, gasoline direct injection (GDI) engine 
technology as an emerging fuel-efficiency 
measure (Saliba et al. 2017; O’Driscoll et al. 
2018) generates more particulate masses and 
numbers than traditional technologies (Liang 
et al. 2012; O’Driscoll et al. 2018). Although 
remedy measures such as gasoline particulate 
filters help mitigate GDI vehicles’ particulate 
emissions (Saliba et al. 2017), they tend to lead 
to fuel economy penalties and CO2 emission 
increases (Mamakos 2011).xvii  
 ▪ For tailpipe emissions, NEV promotion and 
structural changes have co-control potential. 
Nonetheless, for WTW emissions, some 
studies suggest NEV promotion would increase 
GHG emissions and air pollutants when 
electricity generation uses the 2015 power 
mix and hydrogen is produced from coal 
gasification and steam methane reforming 
(Peng et al. 2021). Likewise, due to coal-
dependent electricity generation and the 
use of diesel trains and empty backhauls 
of railway shipments, freight mode shift 
from road transport to electric trains tends 
to emit more GHGs, PM, and NOx (Shao 
2020). Therefore, for NEV promotion and 
freight mode shift to yield air quality and 
climate co-benefits, the measures must be 
coupled with decarbonization of the upstream 
power and industrial sectors as well as 
railway electrification and improvements in 
operational efficiency.

Decarbonizing China’s Road Transport Sector: Strategies toward Carbon Neutrality

CONCLUSION  
AND DISCUSSION
Although this study examines how China's road transport 
sector might be decarbonized, it also has limitations such as 
the unidimensional goal of GHG emission mitigation, the lack 
of causal links between interventions and policy targets, and 
the underestimation of certain emissions. 
CHAPTER 5

70
WRI.org.cn
China’s road transport sector plays an important 
role in meeting carbon early peaking and carbon 
neutrality goals. This study examines how the 
sector might be decarbonized by modelling five 
scenarios using the LEAP model. The results 
indicate the following:
First, in the medium term, the peaking timeline for 
GHG emissions from China’s road transport sector 
would be during 2025–35 and that for petroleum 
demand would be during 2024–30 under all 
scenarios except Business as Usual. If the country’s 
stated policies are effectively implemented over 
time, China could peak road transport emissions 
before 2030 and petroleum consumption before 
2027. The peaking timeline could be further 
advanced to 2025 for GHG emissions and 2024 for 
petroleum consumption by employing structural 
change measures. 
Second, over the long term, with policy 
interventions, it would be possible to reduce 
road transport GHG emissions in 2060 by 50–95 
percent from 2020’s level. To achieve the largest 
emission reduction potential of 95 percent, 
vehicle electrification, structural changes, fuel 
efficiency improvements, and power and hydrogen 
decarbonization are critical. 
This study has the following limitations: 
 ▪ First, we designed the scenarios to meet 
the unidimensional goal of GHG emission 
mitigation, which may not ensure that other 
sustainable development goals will also be met. 
For example, to alleviate traffic congestion, 
promote social equity, reduce road safety risks, 
and lessen public expenditure, more proactive 
structural change measures would be required.
 ▪ Second, the causal links between policy 
interventions (such as public subsidies and road 
pricing) and the attainment of policy targets 
(such as vehicle electrification and structural 
changes) are weak. Future quantitative analysis 
is necessary to strengthen the causal links and 
inform better policymaking.
 ▪ Third, air pollutants from motor vehicles 
vary significantly depending on the extent of 
aftertreatment device degradation, driving 
cycles, vehicle loads, weather conditions, 
and more. Without taking these factors into 
consideration, this study may overstate the 
effectiveness of the China 6 emission standard. 
Over the long term, with policy 
interventions, it would be possible to 
reduce road transport GHG emissions 
in 2060 by 50–95 percent from 
2020’s level.

SOCIOECONOMIC 
ASSUMPTIONS AND

METHODS
The socioeconomic assumptions of this study 
are based on the Shared Socioeconomic 
Pathways (SSPs) (Riahi et al. 2012), which are 
a set of socioeconomic projections (including 
for population and GDP) widely adopted by 
the integrated assessment model community. 
Among six SSP pathways, SSP2 was adopted 
for this analysis because it is designed to extend 
historical trends. In the SSP2 pathway (Figure 
A1), China’s population is forecast to peak

around 2025–30 at 1.39 billion. The GDP projection 
follows China’s “New Normal,” and per capita GDP is 
expected to increase to US$44,806 (in 2005 constant 
dollars) in 2060, almost seven times the 2010 level.
Passenger car ownership 
forecasting method
We used the Gompertz model (Equation 8) to model 
the long-term relationship between passenger car 
stocks and GDP per capita and to forecast China’s 
future passenger car ownership. 
V(x)=γe αe βx
 (Equation 8)
where, 
V(x) is the estimated vehicles per 1,000 persons
x is GDP per capita
γ is the future vehicle saturation level
α and β  are the coefficients to be estimated using the 
equation 
Equation 8 is transformed into Equation 9, which 
can be solved by linear regression: 
ln(ln(V(x)-lnγ)=ln(α)+ βx (Equation 9)
We estimated the Gompertz curve using historical 
data on China’s GDP per capita and vehicles per 
1,000 persons (NBS 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 
2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 
2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019) as well as the 
assumed future car saturation levels. Based on 
the literature reviewed in Section 3.2.1, this study 
assumes that the saturation levels for car ownership 
would be 300 cars per 1,000 persons in the BAU 
scenario and 425 cars per 1,000 persons in the 
Structural Change scenario in 2060. The empirical 
results are shown in Figure A2. The results are 
statistically significant and indicate that China’s car 
ownership is situated in the rapid growth stage and 
future maximum car ownership could range from 
381 to 506 million.

Domestic freight tkm forecasting 
method 
We employed the elasticity method that is 
commonly used in integrated assessment models to 
model the long-term nonlinear relationship among 
freight tkm, GDP per capita, and fuel (carbon) 
prices. 
D(x)=α∙x β
         ∙ x price  (Equation 10)
where,
D(x) is the estimated freight demand
x income and x price   are the indexes for income per capita 
and fuel (carbon) prices compared 
with the starting year (1990)
α is the starting year’s calibrated coefficient
β and γ  are the long-term income elasticity and 
price elasticity, respectively, to be estimated 
using the equation

Based on historical observations (1990–2020), we 
estimated China’s long-term income elasticity for 
freight tkm. The result shows that the elasticity is 
higher than that in the United States (from 1980 to 
2018) but slightly lower than that in Germany (from 
1990 to 2020) (see Table A1). Using Germany as 
a benchmark, this study assumes China’s income 
elasticity will remain fixed at 0.99.
For price elasticity, this study assumes the effect 
of fuel prices on freight demand was limited in the 
past but will become significant in the future. Using 
existing modelled elasticities in Edelenbosch et al. 
(2017), the study assumes China’s long-term price 
elasticity will vary from -0.2 to -0.5 between 2020 and 
2030, and from -0.5 to -0.7 between 2030 and 2060.
The projected result shows that China’s freight 
demand is situated at the rapid growth stage and 
that future freight demand will plateau at 25.9 
trillion tkm in 2055–60.

APPENDIX B.  
LIFETIME TOTAL 
COST OF OWNERSHIP 
PROJECTION
The TCO of zero-emission vehicles is 
anticipated to decline rapidly due to 
continuous reductions in battery pack costs, 
research and development (R&D) expenses, 
warranty costs (i.e., cost of failure), and 
energy efficiency improvements. Further, 
this study assumes that the capital cost of 
ICE vehicles will experience a slight increase 
over time with tightened fuel efficiency and 
exhaust emission standards. The rest of the 
costs are assumed to be constant. 
 ▪ The reduction in battery pack costs  
is attributed to two factors—a lower 
unit cost for battery packs and smaller 
battery capacities due to an improved 
energy intensity of electric vehicles. 
The decline in the unit cost for battery 
packs is captured by the “learning curve” 
that describes the reduction in unit 
production costs of battery packs as a 
function of accumulated production 
volumes, approximated by electric 
vehicle sales volumes in this study. Using 
data on China’s battery pack prices and 
production volumes to perform the 
regression, we estimated the learning 
coefficient of unit production costs of 
battery packs to be -0.26 (learning rate 
= 17 percent). Our projection for future 
energy intensity improvements is based 
on a literature review.

where, 
b is the learning coefficient 
Vt is the production volume in year t
Vo  is the production volume in year 0 (the 
base year of the study)
 ▪ The reduction in the indirect costs 
for R&D and warranty expenses are 
reflected in the falling values of indirect 
cost multipliers over time. Specifically, we 
inferred the indirect costs based on the

APPENDIX C.  
BIOFUEL CONSIDERATIONS
Biofuels are not considered in the 
research because their supply, cost, and 
environmental performance will restrict their 
future adoption. 
First, there are bottlenecks in biofuel 
feedstock supplies. For example, because 
of the supply shortage in crops and 
food security concerns, China’s ethanol 
production was 2.84 million tonnes in 
2019, unable to meet the demand of 13 
million tonnes if all the gasoline were to be 
10 percent blended with ethanol (QDIBBT 
2019). Second-generation biofuels xviii with 
different sources of feedstock—mainly from 
waste and plant cellulose—have similar 
challenges. By one estimate, the total waste 
in the United States (including agricultural 
residue, food waste, sewer sludge, and 
manure) would generate 22.3 gigaliters/year 
of biocrude oil and meet only 23.9 percent 
of current U.S. aviation kerosene demand 
(Skaggs et al. 2018). 
Further, in the absence of policy incentives, the 
uptake of biofuels would be unlikely to occur. 
Biofuels are more expensive than fossil fuels: The 
production cost of biofuels in China is around 
5,000–6,000 CNY per ton, about the same as 
the wholesale price of gasoline/diesel (around 
5,200–6,300 CNY).xix Strong policy supports 
would therefore be necessary to promote 
its adoption. However, a national subsidy 
to oil refineries for biofuel production 
(1,883 CNY per tonne in 2005) ended in 
2016 due to concern that the large demand 
for biofuel feedstocks would threaten food 
security. Further, China has no intention of 
imposing a quota obligation like the EU’s 
Renewable Energy Directive or the United 
States’ Renewable Fuel Standard, which 
mandate a minimum share of biofuels (or 
low-carbon fuels) sold. Last but not the least, 
the environmental performance of biofuels 
may not justify public supports. Studies 
show biodiesel (20 percent blend) increases 
hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions 
by 7 percent and 10 percent, respectively 
(O’Malley and Searle 2021).

i. NEVs include battery electric vehicles (BEVs), plug-in hybrid 
electric vehicles (PHEVs), and fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs).
ii. The China 6 emission standard refers to the Stage 6 Limits and 
Measurement Methods for Emissions from Light-Duty Vehicles 
(GB18352.6–2016) and the Stage VI Limits and Measurement 
Methods for Emissions from Heavy-Duty Vehicles (GB17691–2018). 
China 6 is China ’s most up-to-date vehicle exhaust emission 
standard with the air pollutant limits equating to those of Euro 6.  
iii. China’s NEV policies target passenger carriers, goods carriers, 
and special purpose vehicles; motorcycles are not included. 
iv. Other forms of TCO include the ﬁrst-owner TCO and second-
owner TCO, among others. 
v. For charging infrastructure CAPEX, we excluded the expensive 
grid upgrade investments in the calculation.  
vi. A less transport-intensive service sector could play a role in 
decoupling freight demand from GDP growth.
vii. China’s per capita freight demand was 8,000 tkm in 2020, and 
less than 22,900 tkm per capita in the United States, Australia, 
and Canada (ITF 2012).
viii. Partly because of the truck industry’s overloading and underbidding.
ix. Partly because of the truck industry’s overloading and underbidding.
x. Two to three times maximum loading capacity.
xi. The large range is due to different deﬁnitions and scopes of TCO 
in the literature, from ﬁrst-owner TCO (ﬁrst 5 to 6 years of useful 
life) to lifetime TCO (10 to 15 years of useful life). 
xii. BEVs are unable to carry high loads over long distances. FCEVs 
are expensive and fuel cell systems have limited cycle lives. 
xiii. New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) (Phases I–IV) and WLTP 
(Phase V) for passenger cars. C-WTVC for commercial vehicles. 
xiv. In 2020, SUVs and multiple purpose vehicles comprised 52 per -
cent of passenger car sales (increasing from 15 percent in 2010) 
and tractor trailers comprised 45 percent of HDT sales (increasing 
from 15 percent in 2012).   
xv. Fossil fuels include coal, natural gas, and oil products. 
xvi. In this study, we considered investments in commercial NEV ac -
quisition and operations as well as capital investments in transit, 
active mobility, and freight railway infrastructure, all of which are 
absent in other studies.
xvii. Gasoline particulate ﬁlters’ overall global warming effect was 
found to be neutral as the reduction in black carbon (classiﬁed 
as PM10) could counteract the increase in fuel consumption (CO 2 
emissions).  
xviii. Second-generation biofuels are produced from waste and plant 
cellulose (such as crop residues) compared with ﬁrst-generation 
biofuels, which were produced from crops. The advanced biofuels 
have many beneﬁts, such as a higher decarbonization potential 
and alleviation of food-security risks.

ABOUT WRI 
World Resources Institute is a global research organization that turns big 
ideas into action at the nexus of environment, economic opportunity, and 
human well-being.
Our Challenge
Natural resources are at the foundation of economic opportunity and 
human well-being. But today, we are depleting Earth’s resources at rates 
that are not sustainable, endangering economies and people’s lives. 
People depend on clean water, fertile land, healthy forests, and a stable 
climate. Livable cities and clean energy are essential for a sustainable 
planet. We must address these urgent, global challenges this decade.
Our Vision
We envision an equitable and prosperous planet driven by the wise 
management of natural resources. We aspire to create a world where the 
actions of government, business, and communities combine to eliminate 
poverty and sustain the natural environment for all people.
Our Approach
COUNT IT
We start with data. We conduct independent research and draw on the 
latest technology to develop new insights and recommendations. Our 
rigorous analysis identifies risks, unveils opportunities, and informs smart 
strategies. We focus our efforts on influential and emerging economies 
where the future of sustainability will be determined.
CHANGE IT
We use our research to influence government policies, business 
strategies, and civil society action. We test projects with communities, 
companies, and government agencies to build a strong evidence base. 
Then, we work with partners to deliver change on the ground that allevi-
ates poverty and strengthens society. We hold ourselves accountable to 
ensure our outcomes will be bold and enduring.
SCALE IT
We don’t think small. Once tested, we work with partners to adopt and 
expand our efforts regionally and globally. We engage with decision-mak-
ers to carry out our ideas and elevate our impact. We measure success 
through government and business actions that improve people’s lives 
and sustain a healthy environment.
